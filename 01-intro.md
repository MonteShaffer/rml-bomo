# Restoring Mormon Lore

## Introduction
"Ah-nee [an-i] | nah-fee [naf-i] | ahl-yah [al-a] | ahl-ma [al-ma] | ee-ma [i-ma] | mor-mon-yah [mor-mon-a]"

### Implication
This may possibly be the first sounds intended from the writings on the small plates of "Nephi."  

#### Language 
- Language is derived from "lengua" meaning tongue.  Language by definition is spoken using the mouth (and often the tongue for a specific sound); written language is a poor descriptor (which historians love) as written symbols are intended to be some map to either sound or ideas.
- Languages are broken.  We say Latin is a "dead" language because no one today knows how to speak the language.  Other languages are in a broken state: they still exist but have evolved (devolved) into a modern form that is significantly altered from the original language form.  As English speakers, we can compare early- or middle-English to modern English and verify this proposition.  Now consider a much older language, like Hebrew with the significant exilic change point.  Or an ancient and "dead" language like Egyptian.
- The homo sapien ("humanoid that thinks") has a vocal system that is rather uniform:  lungs, vocal chords, tongue, lips, teeth, mouth cavity with nasal escape.  The combination of these elements create a finite number of sounds, with slight variances.  Phoibles have an inventory of common sounds [https://phoible.org/parameters] yet this is anchored to subtleties that likely can be defined with less than 50 unique sounds isolated into combination pairs.  A good sound-character map would be unique and atomic: unique means that a single character symbol would map to a single sound; atomic means that the single symbol-sound cannot be further decomposed.  That is, two unique sounds can create a compound sound, but itself would not be classified as a unique singleton ([ny] in canyon would not need its own symbol [ñ] or [ɲ] whereas [ch] would need one single character such as the Russian [ч]).
- The primary homo-sapien language systems likely consists of 5 core vowels (with a sixth neutral-state vowel) and 25-30 core consonants that can be combined in various full and partial pairs and triads.

#### Writings
Written symbols, in the case of Nephi's symbols, are etched onto a metal leaf or tablet.  These symbols may be a mapping to specific sounds, or may be expressing ideas directly without a mapping to any particular sound.  Consider for example an IKEA instruction guide for assembling a piece of furniture.  I can infer from the symbols what tasks need to be performed in a universal way without the need of a vocalized language.  The stick figure of a human holding a hammer is NOT intended to be vocalized as language.  However, 2000 years in the future, some clever soul may find this artifact and erroneously create a vocalized mapping of the symbols to sounds and even claim a certain degree of accuracy (say 95%).  Nevertheless, that does NOT mean it was intended as such.  Now apply this principle to so-called experts in Egyptian, Mayan, or Hebrew.  QED.

What is classified as Ancient Egyptian symbols are very similar to what is classified as ancient Hebrew.  If we accept the traditional "Judeo-Christian" narrative, the distinctions may be key anchors in better understanding these ancient languages.  Consider the "m" and "n" confusion.  In Hebrew, the "mem" or "mayim" is the symbol for water; the same symbol is allegedly pronounced as "n" in Egyptian.  If the Hebrews lived among the Egyptians for 200 or more years, there would need to be a method to distinguish the sound intended ("m" or "n") and the language being used (Egyptian or Hebrew).

Now to further exacerbate the confusion of "m" and "n", a homo sapien pronounces such sounds in a manner that is very difficult to distinguish when processing the vocalization.  Consider the two Russian words много (men-o-ga as 'a lot') and немного (ni-men-o-ga as 'not a lot' or 'a little').  Without appropriate context, such adjacent sound confusion could lead to a completely incorrect interpretation of the message to be communicated.  Did the speaker mean "a lot" or the exact opposite "not a lot" as in "a little".  

The lingua franca of Ancient America (generally called Old Tupí or Tupí-Guaraní which linguistically evolved into dialects commonly called Taíno, Arawak, Quechuan, and Algonquian) has tried to remove the volcalization confusion by pairing the "m" with the "b" (which uses the lips) and the "n" with the "d" (where the tongue touches the roof of the mouth and maybe teeth).  So in Tupí-Guaraní many words have been written with "mb" and "nd" pairs to clarify which sound (and possibly the context of the use will inform the conversant whether the "m" or "b" was being clarified).  For example, prepending the "m" to "bya" to form "mbya":  bia means arrival in modern Hebrew, and "mbya" in Old Tupí may mean generically an "event thing" or in some contexts, arrival (as in the SE Brasilian beach where the man without sea legs wishes to arrive).  Such an understanding provides valuable insight into the use of "Colon-mbia"  (Colon-arrived or Colon-arrival) after 1492 in the Western Hemisphere known as the "Americas".  

### Unknowns
The phrase "Ah-nee [an-i] | nah-fee [naf-i] | ahl-yah [al-a] | ahl-ma [al-ma] | ee-ma [i-ma] | mor-mon-yah [mor-mon-a]" is NOT certain.  It is a placeholder to iterate and update as more information becomes available.  However, this prior is essential to beginning to understand the Ancient Record that got "translated" and published as the Book of Mormon in 1830 with Joseph Smith, Jr. being designated the primary author.

[An-i] is likely a shortened rendition of [Am-ano-ki] or [Am-ana-zi]: 'I belong to (or I am derived from) the people from above.'  [ana-zi] may indicate an in-group people whereas [ano-ki] may represent another group.  So when language is interpreted, there needs to be an understanding that there may be 2+ groups of people (ancestors) from above with which a human may identify.  [An-i] in the root is impartial to which side (or sides) and merely emphasizes "I am a star seed" meaning my ancestory comes from the celestial, above this earth.

[Naf-i] again has the [i] ending meaning "my" or belonging to a thing.  "I am" [Naf] is literally saying many many things in Egyptian and is a powerful word play.  I am good.  I am the wind in the sails.  I am the fire starter (see 1 Esdras 5:21).  I am a doer.  I am a sojourner (fallen from original abode).  I am a life.  I am large in stature.  (And so on).  Likely, this name was a shortened form of the main character's birth name:  Naphtali (or Nephtali: if you ask a Luthern or a Catholic there will be disagreement over the first vowel).  Over time, as the language evolved (devolved), [An-i] [Naf-i] may have truncated to [ni] still meaning this central founding character.  

[al-a] or [al-yah] decomposed into its fundamental elements is two alephs (cows) surrounding a lamad (staff) which implies teaching.  That is, two cows are teaching: one on the left of the lamad and one on the right of the lamad.  Semantically, [al-a] may mean to "spring forth" like a plant does from the ground.  [al] may also signify the God [el] and [a] may signify the God [yah] as in [jehovah].  If order is important, this seems to be [el] first like in [el]-[i]-[yah] (elijay) whereas the inverse would be [yah]-[i][el] like in Joel or Jael and possibly [eesh][yah][i][el] which phonetically could degrade to Israel (maybe the Egyptian [ra] was actually [yah]).

[ma] can be an important marker for water-cow (or middle-first).  The inverse [am] as cow-water often means people (or first-middle).  The [amt] may represent the first, middle, and last letters of the ancient alphabet: cow-water-cross where the cross had a significant Hebrew meaning before the inception of the modern Christian meaning.  Taken together [amt] may mean truth as in the expression attributed to Yeshua:  I am a way, a life, a truth.

[al-ma] could represent a relationship to the different forms of competing gods: [el]-[m]-[yah] where [m] can alone represent the chaotic state associated with the water symbol in ancient traditions.  [a][lm][a] is again two cows surrounding a lamed (teaching) and a mayim (water):  two cows teaching within the chaos.  [ma] can mean generically thing and in Tupí-Guaraní would become [mba] which is unique from [mbia] or [mboe] and so on.  The variants may distinguish the nature of the thing: a place, a person, an event, and so on.

[i] as an ending can infer "my" or "I am" but at the beginning or as an isolate can also represent the shoreline or river islands.  That is, in the vast emptiness of the seas/oceans, land is seen which is a symbol of hope and arrival ([bia] as possibly [ba-i-yah]: soul-my-jehovah).  In the fractal of the celestial, the ocean can be the vast emptiness of space, and the [i] can be a habitable planet.

[i-ma] or [im-yah] could be to emphasize or demonstrate the certainty of [yah] as [jehovah].  [jehovah] was likely a pentagram palindrom originally (in sound and symbol). [im] may be the plural of [i].

[mor][mon][yah] is a combination of two significant roots followed by [yah] for [jehovah].  More to follow on this wordplay and significance, but likely, taken as a whole [mormona] may be the name one group of celestials give to this third rock from the sun which we call Earth in our Solar System.  That is, this planet is a river island in space, on which, there are river islands (continents) and within which, there are sometimes rivers with islands. 

### Foundation for Education
The small plates of Nephi were intended to be a teaching instrument for his children.  Nephi saw a vision of the many works he was capable of doing.  He spent his life doing them.  And it would seem, one of these works was to prepare a collection of teachings that were "plain and precious" specifically for his children: a specific, and concrete task (very Egyptian).  I estimate he had help (spouse, family, friends) in the preparation of the key lessons to be taught, but Nephi emphasizes that the final collection he etched with his own hand.

As such, the legend of Nephi (the small plates) is analagous to the Blue-Back Speller introduced by Noah Webster in 1783 with a common edition being the 1824 version.  The intent of the Blue-Back Speller was to be a one-stop resource to teach the populace the American English language and logic of American thought (ethics, government, economics, and so on); that is, how to live like an American.

Interestingly, the small plates of Nephi had a very similar objective written over two millenia earlier:  how to live like an American where AM-MER-MAKRA is an ancient word (Hebrew/Egyptian) with several possible meanings, one being: [PEOPLE-LEADER-TENDER MERCY] people with leadership that exudes tender mercy (where leader could represent Nephi specifically or God generally).



#### Pedagogy of Introduction 
I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents ... this English rendition is lacking the depth of the original proposed text, but it is sufficient to understand the teaching apparatus:  (1) the first person is introduced with accompanying verb forms, (2) state your name when introducing yourself, (3) state your genealogy when introducing yourself, (4) define you parentage including the celestial domain, (5) introduce literary forms such as alliteration, palindromes, and the spiral/circular non-sentence structure.


Ancient American peoples would likely try to define themselves "we the people" in relationship to this father-founder Nephi; for example [nimíipuu] may describe a group with three migrations: [ni] representing Nephi, [míi] possibly representing Mosiah, and [pu] representing the unknown leader that lead "us" [u] to the Pacific Northwest, to the Colombia River system.  Locals would call this group of foreigners [sahaptin] and cousins would have playful names for them: "those that build the small boats". 

##### Temple as Awareness Indicator
As one delves into the life and legend of Nephi, marketing efforts to increase the awareness of his ministry among those who do NOT know him (the old nation described by Isaiah) will become obvious.  Like construct a large, white, alabaster-like (titi or teet-teet) building located to maximize visibility atop a high point in the region.  Possibly with a steel lightning rod to offer another spectacle in a rainstorm. 

The flat mesa where this building was constructed may have been called a "tepui" by the locals.  Or the locals may have seen the phenomenon which was described to them in Egyptian as "peru taui-upi" or "peru upi-taui" (or some similar arrangement) meaning the house/temple of the sun-god or fire-god.  Regardless, associating the building "high on a mountain top with a banner unfurled as a ensign to the nations" with a unique and specific term would be intuitive: what in marketing would be called a brand. (What was written on the banner?  Maybe "in memory of: God, religion, freedom, peace, wives, and children" which inspired a naval captain hundreds of years later.)

Nephi was the one who led the construction of the temple of Jehovah atop the mesa "tepui" so a potential title for Nafi could be Tupí (that building is "my tup").  And the God of this guy Tupí would naturally be Tupí-yah or Tupã.  And like Jehovah in the Levant, this was the storm god associated with thunder and lightning.

Q: Sais Quoi?  
A: That thing is "tepui" and was built by Tupí. 
And now, the legend of Tupí-Guaraní curated by Bartolomé de las Casas (in the early 1500s) aligns: two brothers arrive by boat(s), one is white (good heart and literally white) and the other is black (bad heart and becomes literally black).  Furthermore, Nephi may have had many names, or his children may have carried on his work and independently received such names:  KHON-TI-TI (Kontiki) or BA-EE-YAH-CO-CHA (Viracocha).

The ministry of Nephi was an adoption process.  Once another group was encountered through awareness, Nephi would engage as a servant-leader and protector, fulfilling many of the prophecies of Isaiah:  a nursing father, kings would have their sons work for this great KORESH, turning swords into plough-shares to throw dirt and make raised earth works, go to the river islands and defend the helpless from those that grind the face of the poor, use the rivers as protection (walls made low), and so on.  

If the locals were satisfied with the adoption of Nephi's teachings and technologies, they would diffuse their understanding to others: family and friends.  The ministry of Nephi included a proselyting function.   Teaching the locals how to live would have improved their quality of life, giving them more free time, and protecting them from those that would want to enslave them.  


Order is important for adoption:  if Nephi "saves" them telestially (no longer a slave and has basic sustanance: food/housing) first, then terrestially a society/government could develop and then the celestial reasons for the telestial/terrestial efforts could be more easily adopted.  Joseph Smith may have later understood this to be the concept of the United Order which would necessitate a different concept of economics:  one of abundance, not scarcity.  That is, work we must, but lunch is free.

Modern marketing describes this adoption process as the AIDAS funnel:  Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action, Satisfaction.  

#### Word flower as marketing pamphlet
Many of those with whom Nephi would interact would NOT understand the vocal language, but the symbols written could diffuse a significant part of the message nonetheless.  A bit of bitumen or black pitch from a rubber tree, or some other form of blackened paint/ink would make the first metal leaf of the tablet available as a stamp on tor-tor or other papyrus.  The largest symbol was likely what we would classify modernly as an "ankh symbol with a double-cross inverted vertically" and the overall design of the first page was likely radial from this anchor like a word flower.  This would be similar to how scrabble pivots to create other words in an orthogonal way; however, this design would be circular or spiral representing an 'eternal round.'

The oval shape within Egyptian may represent a mouth, an eye, or the head of a man.  Order is important and represents an ego-relationship between man and the celestial.  For example, this large double-cross symbol is above the oval head below.  That is the celestial is above the man.  The negation is seen in one of the word-examples "nefer / nefer n" where the negation can be the positive with a negation symbol.  The snake/slug is above the mouth, a sign of goodness: the celestial is above the man.  The final symbol seems to be pure negation, the "n" symbolized by two hands connected to an inverted inverted U.  The other negation is placing the mouth above water-symbol shape:  man is above the celestial.
