# Restoring Mormon Lore

## Introduction
"Ah-nee [an-i] | nah-fee [naf-i] | ahl-yah [al-a] | ahl-ma [al-ma] | ee-ma [i-ma] | mor-mon-yah [mor-mon-a]"

### Implication
The may possibly be the first sounds intended from the writings on the small plates of "Nephi."  

#### Language 
- Language is derived from "lengua" meaning tongue.  Language by definition is spoken using the mouth (and often the tongue for a specific sound); written language is a poor descriptor (which historians love) as written symbols are intended to be some map to either sound or ideas.
- Languages are broken.  We say Latin is a "dead" language because no one today knows how to speak the language.  Other languages are in a broken state: they still exist but have evolved (devolved) into a modern state that is very unlikely to be similar to the original language form.  As English speakers, we can compare the early or mid English to modern English and verify this proposition.  Now consider a much older language, like Hebrew.  Or an even older and "dead" language like Egyptian.
- The homo sapien ("humanoid that thinks") has a vocal system that is rather uniform:  lungs, vocal chords, tongue, lips, teeth, mouth cavity.  The combination of these elements create a finite number of sounds, with slight variances.  Phoibles have an inventory of common sounds [https://phoible.org/parameters] yet this is anchored to subtleties that likely can be defined with less than 50 unique sounds isolated into combination pairs.  A good sound-character map would be unique: a single character mapping to a single sound *AND* would be atomic: two unique sounds can create a compound sound, but itself would not be classified as a unique singleton [ny in canyon].
- The primary language systems likely consists of 5 primary vowels and 25 primary consonants.

#### Writings
Written symbols, in this case etched onto a metal leaf or tablet, may be a mapping to such sounds, or may be expressing ideas and not sounds.  Consider for example an IKEA instruction guide for assembling a piece of furniture.  I can infer from the symbols what tasks need to be performed in a universal way without the need of a vocalized language.  That does not mean the stick figure of a human holding a hammer is intended to be vocalized as language.  However, 2000 years in the future, some clever soul may find this artifact and erroneously create a vocalized mapping of the symbols to sounds and even claim a certain degree of accuracy (say 95%).  Nevertheless, that does NOT mean it was intended as such.  Now apply this principle to so-called experts in Egyptian, Mayan, or Hebrew.  QED.

What is classified as Ancient Egyptian symbols are very similar to what is classified as ancient Hebrew.  If we accept the traditional "Judeo-Christian" narrative, the distinctions may be key anchors in better understanding these ancient languages.  Consider the "m" and "n" confusion.  In Hebrew, the "mem" or "mayim" is the symbol for water; the same symbol is allegedly pronounced as "n" in Egyptian.  Now to further exacerbate the confusion, the homo sapien pronouncing such sounds are difficult to distinguish.  Consider the two Russian words (minigo/nimingo).  One language has tried to remove the volcalization confusion by pairing the "m" with the "b" (which uses the lips) and the "n" with the "d" (where the tongue touches the roof of the mouth and maybe teeth).  So in Tupí-Guaraní many words have been written with "mb" and "nd" pairs to clarify which sound (and possibly the context of the use will inform the conversant whether the "m" or "b" was being clarified:  "mbya" with the "m" clarifying the "bia" (bia means arrival in modern Hebrew, and "mbya" may mean generically "thing" or in some contexts, arrival [as in the Brasilian beach where the man without sea legs wishes to arrive]).  Such an understanding provides a different context to the use of "Colon-mbia" after 1492 in the Western Hemisphere known as the "Americas".  

### Unknowns
The phrase "Ah-nee [an-i] | nah-fee [naf-i] | ahl-yah [al-a] | ahl-ma [al-ma] | ee-ma [i-ma] | mor-mon-yah [mor-mon-a]" is NOT certain.  It is a placeholder to iterate and update as more information becomes available.  However, this guess is essential to beginning to understand the Ancient Record that got "translated" and published as the Book of Mormon in 1830 with primary author being Joseph Smith, Jr.

[An-i] is likely a shortened rendition of [Am-ano-ki] or [Am-ana-zi]: I belong or am derived from the people from above.  [ana-zi] may indicate an in-group people whereas [ano-ki] may represent another group.  So when language is interpreted, there needs to be an understanding that there may be 2+ groups of people (ancestors) from above with which a human may identify.  [An-i] in the root is impartial to which side (or sides) and merely emphasizes "I am a star seed" meaning my ancestory comes from the celestial, above this earth.

[Naf-i] again has the "i" ending meaning "my" or belonging to a thing.  "I am" [Naf] is literally saying many many things in Egyptian and is a powerful word play.  I am good.  I am the wind in the sails.  I am a doer.  I am a sojourner (fallen from original abode).  I am a life.  I am large.  (and so on).  Likely, this name was a shortened form of the main character's birth name:  Naphtali (or Nephtali if you ask a Luthern or a Catholic there will be disagreement).  Over time, as the language devolved, [An-i] [Naf-i] may have truncated to [ni] meaning this central founding character.

[al-a] decomposed into its fundamental elements is two alephs (cows) surrounding a lamad (staff) which implies teaching.  That is, two cows are teaching.  This may mean to "spring forth" like a plant does from the ground.  [al] may also signify the God [el] and [a] may signify the God [yah] as in [jehovah].  If order is important, this seems to be [el] first like in [el]-[i]-[yah] (elijay) whereas the inverse would be [yah]-[i][el] like in Joel or Jael and possibly [eesh][yah][i][el] which degrades to Israel.

[ma] can be an important marker for water-cow.  The inverse [am] as cow-water often means people.  The [amt] may represent the first, middle, and last letters of the ancient alphabet: cow-water-cross where the cross had a signficant Judean meaning before the concept of the Christian meaning.  Taken together [amt] may mean truth as in the expression attributed to Yeshua:  I am a way, a life, a truth.

[ee] as an ending can infer "my" or "I am" but also can represent the shoreline or river islands.  That is, in the vast emptiness of the seas/oceans, land is seen which is a symbol of hope and arrival.  In the fractal, the ocean can be the vast emptiness of space, and the [ee] can be a habitable planet.

[eem][yah] could be to emphasize or demonstrate the certainty of [yah] as [jehovah].  [jehovah] was likely a pentagram palindrom (in sound and symbol).

[mor][mon][yah] is a combination of two significant roots followed by [yah] for [jehovah].  More to follow on this wordplay and significance, but likely, taken as a whole [mormona] may be the name one group of celestials give to this third rock from the sun which we call Earth in our Solar System.  That is, this planet is a river island in space, on which, there are river islands (continents) and within which, there are sometimes rivers with islands.

### Foundation for Education
The small plates of Nephi is analagous to the Blue-Back Speller introduced by Noah Webster in 1783 with a common edition being the 1824 version.  The intent of the Blue-Back Speller was to be a one-stop resource to teach the populace the American English language and logic of American thought (ethics, government, economics, and so on); that is, how to live like an American.

Similarly, the small plates of Nephi was teaching a different time, but the same objective:  how to live like an American where AM-MER-MAKRA is an ancient word with several possible meanings, one being: people with leader that shows tender mercy (where leader could represent Nephi specifically or God generally).

Nephi saw a vision where he had work to do.  He saw his children and a primary proposition is that the "plain and precious" things were NOT for the "children of men" generically but for the "children of this man" specifically.

#### Introduction revisited
I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents ... this English rendition is lacking the depth of the original proposed text, but is sufficient to understand the teaching apparatus:  (1) the first person is introduced, (2) state your name when introducing yourself, (3) state your genealogy when introducing yourself.

#### Word flower as marketing pamphlet
Many of those with whom Nephi would interact would NOT understand the vocal language, but the symbols written could diffuse nonetheless.  A bit of bitumen or black pitch from a rubber tree, or some other form of blackened paint/ink would make the first metal leaf of the tablet available as a stamp on tor-tor or other papyrus.  The largest symbol was likely what we would classify as an "ankh with a cross" and the overall shape was likely radial from the anchor [I Nephi] similar to scrabble but radial rather than orthogonal.  

##### Temple as Awareness Indicator
As one delves into the life and legend of Nephi, such marketing efforts to increase the awareness of his people among those who do NOT know him will become obvious.  Like putting a large white-alabaster building on the highest point in the area, a flat mesa thereafter likely became known as "tepui": Nephi was given the name Tupí by some locals for this building - the temple of Jehovah that builded Nephi.  And the God of this guy Tupí would naturally be Tupí-yah or Tupã.  And now, the legend of Tupí-Guaraní curated by Bartolomé de las Casas syncs: two brothers arrive by boat, one is white (good and literally white) and the other is black (bad and becomes literally black).  And Nephi may have had many names, or his children may have carried on his work and independently received such names:  KHON-TI-TI (Kontiki) or BA-EE-YAH-CO-CHA (Viracocha).

Modern marketing describes this adoption process as the AIDAS funnel:  Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action, Satisfaction.  Nephi could NOT minister to the locals without the appropriate materials.
