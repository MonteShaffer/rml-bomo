## Behind the mathematician's curtain 
Many times a mathematician working on a proof does NOT reveal the minutiae that led to the distilled essence and result.  So, it can be difficult to understand "how" one arrived at that conclusion which led to a search for a mathematical proof.  For me, an independent study of the times and seasons associated with the birth and death of the Messiah in association to the numbers provided in the Book of Mormon was the key data that has put me on a path of rediscovery challenging my internal belief systems; at the time, this dilemna led me to consider if Oliver was tricky:  could Oliver have intentionally changed numbers to fit his belief system that would disrupt my calculations?  

### Six-hundred year anchor
For me, the anchor point is the number 600. 

As I disclose my process, please understand that it was non-linear, recursive, and iterative.  My effort to describe it requires taking the complex process of learning and placing the result into a linear frame.

The six hundred year prophecy is anchored to the birth of the Messiah.  And an event associated with Nephi's family when leaving the area of Jerusalem for the deserts of Arabia.

The number 600 in mathematics has embedded within the first perfect number, 6.  Some key ways of arriving at 600 are:  60 × 10; 75 x 8; 50 x 12; 100 x 6.  The story of Noah references the number 600.  Preliminary calculations anchored to year 0 (mathematician's dating system) for the Messianic birth:  Nephi's family around 600 BC, maybe Muhammad around 600 AD (hijra was 622 AD).  Other Abrahamic markers may include:  Abraham, Joseph in Egypt, and/or Moses.  Maybe the great Buddha was born at some point within this special cycle (e.g., 1800 BC), not limiting the pattern to only Abrahamic tradition.

#### Sixty-year Chinese Cycle 
The Chinese have a 60 year cycle (干支) that may be considered a "big year" based on the heaven stems (12) and the earth stems (5) which are decomposed of 5 elements (五行 wuxing): Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood (and the duality of the yin-yang, so technically 120).  

Every 60 years, 5 earth stems pass through 12 heaven stems where the heaven stems are today associated with an animal and an etiological story of a race describes the order of the 12 animals.  The first animal is the Rat, followed by the Ox.  The Ox gave the Rat a ride for a large portion of the race and either the Rat deceived the Ox to win OR the Ox allowed the Rat to win ('you go a head'). 

The symbol for the number 10 in Chinese is the same symbol as the original [tav] of Ancient Hebrew, the symbol of the cross.  The Roman Numeral was merely a rotation of [+] to form an [X].  Six hundred years would be 10 big years; that is 10 cycles of sixty years.

#### Hebrew truth 
In Hebrew, the word for truth/justice/stability consists of three Hebrew letters [amt] (אֱמֶת) where aleph represents a cow, mem represents water (and the chaos of a low-point), and tav represents the cross.  Altogether this may represent the Messianic purpose.

The Messiah may represent a Water Ox that bears a cross, connecting the chronology of the Chinese with the belief that the Messiah would show a way back to the celestial (see John 14:6).  Following traditional Christian anchors, the Messiah was Yeshua.  Yeshua had a cousin, commonly called the Baptist, that would be the precursor for Yeshua:  possibly named Yaḥyā.

#### Water Ox preceded by Water Rat 
The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".  This may represent the Messiah.

The year before the Water Ox is the year of the Water Rat (壬子年]):  [scholar] + [child/progeny] (seed/egg) + [bend-one-ten] (year).   An obvious interpretation could be the "year where a scholar is a seed for one to follow".  That is, the one to precede the Messiah, a cousin that would be a scholar linking the wisdom of the celestial with the learning of men on earth.

Around the year 0, the closest possible year of the Water Ox is 8 BC.  An anchor for the birth of the Messiah.  

### Two celestial signs: a primary and an ultimate 
What are the significant celestial signs that were anchors for the prophecy of the Messianic birth?

#### Herod and the wise men 
In the New Testament, we have a narrative that : (1) a new star appeared in the east leading foreign wise men to the region who were following this star in order to meet the Messianic child; (2) in their local search, these wise men seek an audience with Herod; (3) Herod is curious about the timing of the "new star" as several celestial events had been observed; (4) after learning the "when", Herod reportedly orders that every male born (in the region under the age of two) to be killed; (5) the wise men encounter the child with Mary/Joseph and offer gifts, the family flees into Egypt, and assumingly, the wise men depart the region returning home.  

We can infer Jewish tradition in the birth story.  First, the child would need to be born and, if immediately swaddled and placed in a manager, a lotus-birth would need to be eliminated as a possibility.  Second, the child would be presented to the local synagogue at 8 days old and given a name.  Third, if the child is a male, the naming would be accompanied with a circumcision of the child.  Fourth, a waiting period (likely to see if the child would live), defined as a purification period, would be observed:  8 x 5 = 40 days for a male and 8 x 10 = 80 days for a female.  Thereafter, the child would be presented to God in the temple with sacrificial rituals.  In this case, a firstborn male was (by definition) intended to serve God according to traditions of the House of Jacob.  However, since the decision to empower the tribe of Levi with priestly duties, other tribes could offer a proxy sacrifice known as "redemption of the first born" to absolve the first-born service requirement.  In context of this being a Messianic birth, did such an absolution occur?  
Other questions remain:  How old was the Messiah when the wise men finally found the family?  What exactly was the order and timing of significant traditional events: wise men offer gifts, family flees to Egypt, Herod dies, family returns from Egypt, Messiah at bar mitzvah (age 12) amazes the erudites in the temple, and so on.  How many wise men were there?  Were there also wise women?  Did they give gifts and leave, or did they stay and observe the Messianic life?  Were they tutors for the young child?  Were the wise men locals (from the Abrahamic tradition) or globals (from all regions of the world)?

Just to answer the question of timing (when the Messiah was born), the primary clue from the Herodian story is that significant celestial events were being observed and Herod understood that the sign of the prophesized Messianic birth occurred about two years previously.  So which sign was that?

#### Samuel the Lamanite
Samuel the Lamanite appears to the Ancient Americans after significant celestial events were being observed.  Seemingly, these observations, like in the Levant, created speculation as to their specific meaning.  Before clarifying the meaning of the celestial events, Samuel rebukes the society for the ever-so-common sin of "grinding the face of the poor" (see Isaiah 1).  Samuel then reminds the people of the details of the six-hundred year prophecy.  The initial observation, which I will label the primary marker, had occurred.  However, a more significant sign, a unique and ultimate marker was yet to occur.  That is, the ultimate sign would follow the primary sign by a few years (recorded in the editorialized Book of Mormon as: precisely 5 years from now, which is shortly after the primary sign, an ultimate sign would be given).

Interestingly, about 40 years later, when the Messiah visits America after the resurrection, the scribes are (gently) rebuked for excluding these significant prophecies of Samuel.  Seemingly, the pure-blood guardians of the records made an editorial decision to exclude the words of the brown-skinned outsider.

####  Supernova as ultimate sign 
The ultimate sign was that the sun would set yet the sky for one night would not darken.  That implies that the sign would generate enough light to brighten the sky.  And if this was a global phenomenon (not hemispheric), the bright lights would endure for at least 24 hours. 

In modern vernacular, we may call this event a supernova event described as a powerful and luminous explosion of a star.  The apparent magnitude (or brightness) of a star is a function of its distance from Earth and the intensity of light that the star emits.  This new star was likely previously present in the night sky but was not bright enough to be seen.  If the star exploded, the blast would immediately emit tremendous amounts of light, which would diminish over time as, according to modern theory, the star dies:  a explosion with significant light in the heavens, the source of light is seen as a "new star", the new star continually diminishes in brightness until the star fades from view.    

Johannes Kepler had the opportunity to experience two supernova events in his lifetime.  The first occurred in 1572 when Kepler was an infant, yet later in life he was able to oversee the reprints of Tycho's descriptions to appreciate this event.  The second occurred on 17 October 1604.  This "new star" was the brightest star in the heavens and was visible during the day for twenty or more days and visible at night for over a year. At the time, Kepler believed a supernova event like the two he experienced during his lifetime was the explanation for the Star of Bethlehem in Christian tradition. 

Supernova are rare events.  Often, they are surrounded with controversy.  Some cultures believe supernovae are categorically bad omens; other cultures believe the exact opposite: a supernova as light can only bring good.  Even others cultures consider the celestial rarity to be a message that leads to speculation, discussion, and action.  For example, Queen Elizabeth asked astronomical mathematicians for advice after observing the 1572 supernova.  Or consider the story of Galileo.  Many believe that Galileo used the 1604 event as an impetus to challenge the orthodoxy of Aristotelian physics romanticized with the phrase "E pur si muove".

####  5 April 8 BC: Qingming celebration  
Anchoring to a fixed equinox as March 21, I propose that exactly half a month later (15 days later) would be the timing for the Messianic birth.  That is, 5 April 8 BC.  

Singificant markers for this conclusion include:  Nowruz anchored to human observation not mathematical cycles; Isaiah's reprimand of the house of Jacob using lunations for its calculations; replacing the lunar anchor with a solar anchor (equinox); the basic concept of the Passover occuring mid-month after a celestial marker; a year being defined as exactly 360 days containing 12 months of 30 days BEFORE some celestial event which caused some groups to celebrate these extra days given (epagomenal days that are outside of times/seasons) giving us the modern 365.2422-day year.

Astronomical documentation for a supernova occuring on this date at the moment is unavailable.  The Chinese do have a festival (celebratory holiday) aligning with this date.  The Qingming festival (清明节:  green/blue water + sun/moon brightness + celebration) is defined to be 15 days following the equinox, varying from between 4 April to 6 April.  The festival is associated with bright lights.  On this day, the living visit burial sites of the ancestors and sweep the tombs (as if preparing the ancestors for resurrection).  In addition, this holiday has a reference to a strange master-servant story that demonstrates loyalty and love amidst a trial of shared suffering.

This festival is anchored to a solar marker, not a lunar marker.  Agrarian centers of ancient China would develop calendars anchored to the sun, including: 大明历 (oldest + brightest + calendar), 四分曆  (son enclosure + divide in 10 + experience/history/event), 四時八節曆 (son enclosure + time/season + divide/eight + segment/classify + experience/history/event).  The year would begin on the equinox consisting of months of 30 days.  A month would be segmented into thirds, known as decans.  That is, a 10-day week.  A week would consist of two pentads, or 5-day periods.  Every few years, an extra decan (10-days) would be added to the year (midsummer) to correct for epagomenal differences between the ideal (360 days) and the observed (365.25-ish days) suggesting that the calendar equinox would drift a few days from the actual equinox.  Of note, is the anchor of time to the number ten, specifically, two sets of 5.  Easy to count using your hands.  And anchored to social interactions.  For example, a agrarian worker was told to bathe at least once every 5 days.  Or, an emperor would retreat into his palace and mourn for 5 days.

#### Lyra Comet 1P as primary sign 
The "ultimate" sign, a supernova, was unique and novel.  And it would occur, according to Samuel the Lamanite after a more common and frequent.  This primary sign was likely a comet.  A comet, from earth appears to be a star that is moving with a tail, that changes direction, and then disappears.  And then, after some time, the cycle repeats again:  appears, changes direction, and disappears.  Even within one culture, there have been many names for these "guest stars".

| Chinese  | Meaning | Roots |
| :--:| :------: | :---- |
| 孛星 |   bushy star    | ten + cover + child : sun/day + life |
| 彗星 |   broom star   | abundance + abundance + "pig-snout" : sun/day + life |
| 掃星 |  sweeping star   | hand + "pig-snout" + cover + turban/scarf : sun/day + life |
| 天攙 |  heavenly intermingler   | one + big : knife + mouth + compare/compete + knife + mouth + second + line + dot |
| 篷星 |  sailing star   | bamboo + go + walk + one + two + line : sun/day + life  |
| 長星 |  long star   |  long/grow OR chief/elder OR "pig-snout" + one + bend : sun/day + life  |
| 燭星 |  candle-flame star   |  fire + net + wrap + insect : sun/day + life  |

The most well-known of these moving celestial bodies is vulgarly called the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.  A more culturally-nuetral label, Lyra Comet 1P will be used to describe this recurring phenomenon.

Comet Lyra is has a cyclical orbit, appearing approximately every 75 years: more or less depending on whether the comet gets close to a planet when it enters the planetary region of the solar system and is effected by local gravity.  In addition, the mass of the comet would likely be reduced over time as it emits a stream of material which could possibly create a directional time-trend. 

#### Comets as candidates for the Star of Bethlehem

Chinese records suggest there may be several candidates:  16 BC, 12 BC, 10 BC, 5 BC, 4 BC.  Most dismiss the 16 BC and 10 BC candidates as replicates or not fully developed descriptions.  With a traditional anchor that Herod died in 4 BC, many conclude that the Messianic birth occurred in April of 5 BC.  But what about the two-year boundary condition with the wise men?  And was Herod on his death bed when meeting with the wise men.  Taking all of these details in their entirety, 12 BC is a reasonable anchor for the primary sign, followed by a supernova some time later.

If we take Samuel's words as "5 years exactly", a supernova occuring on 5 April 8 BC would necessitate a lesser-yet-primary sign to occur on 5 April 13 BC.  The Chinese record details the comet being visible on 26 August 12 BC, visible for over 56 days.  The exactness of the 5 years from Samuel is off by at most 222 days.  However, we do not know the details of Samuel the Lamanite prophecy; or rather, a reminder of an more ancient prophecy.  Did the people of Nephi use a solar calendar with an equinox start date?  If the first landing was in South America, would they establish time based on the September equinox?  Or was there a times/seasons recipe for measuring time preserved within the brass plates, originally defined by Abraham or his great-grandson Joseph?  

The six-hundred year prophecy and its relationship to the story of Nephi and his family in Jerusalem will give us some additional insights.

#### Leaving Jerusalem six hundred years earlier
The Messianic prophecy had many celestial markers within the window of the birth date.  We conclude the preliminary marker is a primary, recurring appearance of a comet, approximately 12 BC.  Next, the ultimate marker of the precise birth to occur on 5 April 8 BC.

So, should we also expect two events six-hundred years prior?  First, let's consider the recurring marker of a comet.  Did Comet Lyra 1P appear in 612 BC?  The Chinese did observe a comet at this time; according to Wikipedia, in the year 613 BC; according to a Harvard Research article  (Table II, [https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1982JBAA...92..209B]), a comet appeared in the autumn of 614 BC. 

##### Josiah's life mission and death 
According to biblical chronology, Josiah the King of Jerusalem died in August 609 BC.  About 5 years after the comet appeared.  Was the appearance of Comet Lyra 1P an impetus for Josiah to renovate the temple which led to the discover of lost prophecies and ultimately his death?  Creating a speculative time for everyone living in Jerusalem at the time, witnessing these events.  Maybe young Nephi was only 8 years old when he witnessed this celestial event.  

In the renovation of the temple, lost prophecies were found and carefully studied.  Upon reading them, Josiah rips his garments and goes into mourning.  Thereafter, he seeks counsel from the MISNE.  Huldah, the keeper of the wardrobe, and likely the chief prophetess, gives him guidances.  Seemingly, the prophecy had some references to the feminine worship in the temple, many conclude some reference to the cakes baked for the Queen Mother of Heaven and the Asherah poles/trees that adorned the temple grounds.  The King follows her counsel: the cessation of worship the Queen Mother in the temple (which Jeremiah later second-guesses after Jerusalem falls), tearing down Asherah poles at the temples (the primary in Jerusalem and others throughout the region) and killing some of the priest class, the KOHEN, burning their bones to ash on the altars of these temples.  Very strange narrative, which gets stranger.  The details of the prophecies that motivates these actions has been lost to time; the Deutoronomists and Masoretes (likely members of this priest class) were themselves motivated to editorialize some details of the story.  As a result, the narrative that leads to Josiah's death gets even more bazaar.

##### Josiah retrieves the Ark of the Covenant 
The KOHEN were guardians of the Ark of the Covenant.  King David used this artifact as a weapon of war.  King Solomon retired the weapon placing it within a room within a room: the holy of holies.  Once a year, the KOHEN would send one person in this room to perform ritural ceremonies.  A group of KOHEN who had built a temple in Elephantine (Egypt) may have transferred the Ark of the Covenant out of Jerusalem.  Likely, this group was marching with Necho carrying the artifact to war with the Egyptian leader.  Now, Josiah, marching to intercept this army would make sense.  Necho responds "What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you".  Yet Josiah persists.  

If Josiah was retrieving the Ark of the Covenant, the narrative makes more sense.  "Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you" may be a latent marker for a group of KOHEN carrying the Ark of the Covenant to war for Necho.  The narrative was obfuscated to conceal the KOHEN's potential wrong doing.  Josiah is shot by arrows from Necho's archers and returns to Jerusalem where he dies.  And latently, it would seem, he died successfully retrieving the Ark of the Covenant.  Josiah died in August 609 BC.  

##### The family of Nephi, the Ark of the Covenant, and the Brass Plates 
The political dynamics of Jerusalem would be unprecedented.  Josiah had two wives with diplomatic relationships to competing neighbors from the North and South.  And, it would seem, Nephi's family left the city within a few months following Josiah's death.  And, if you read the narratives carefully, the family took the Ark of the Covenant with them to America where Nephi built a temple to house it.  When the city was sieged in 605 BC and 586 BC, the Ark was not found.  Later prophets voiced that the Ark left the region, never to return.  

And now, some of the narrative of Nephi makes more sense.  Why would Laman, the firstborn, approach the keeper of the treasury, Laban, and just ask for the brass plates?  Nothing is offered in exchange, so it would seem, the family had legal property rights to the records.  Seemingly, when the family packed up their tents (and tabernacle), it was assumed that the brass plates were housed within the Ark of the Covenant.  The Ark contained several significant artifacts (likely including what was described by Nephi as a Liahona).  The record is not found among the artifacts, so the brothers are sent to retrieve them.

Isaiah predicted that the archers/arrows of Kedar would protect a group fleeing south after "binding the tabernacle (tᵊʿûḏâ)", (Isa 8:16).  That this group would be burdened with personal riches on the shoulders of young asses and the wealth of the treasury on humps of camels, carrying the treasures to a land where it will have no value; where the people will consider such things shameful (Isa 30:6).  Well, it would seem that Nephi recovered the family wealth, plus so much more.  Who exactly was the young and old lion?  And who exactly was the viper and the  fiery flying serpent?

##### "Shazer" on 5 April 608 BC: Jacob is born at the Mountain of Almonds (aka Sinai)
The family of Nephi was safely established in tents near a fresh-water well close to the Red Sea.  They had recovered all the artifacts necessary to continue their journey.  They had convinced another family to join them as well.  One of the women was pregnant, soon to give birth to Nephi's brother, Jacob.  Yet, to fulfill prophecy, the family must move a short distance before "Shazer" so the Liahona is the impetus to force the men to break-down camp and the women to raise their skirts to cross the nearby high-water river (Isa 47:2), travel four days SSE and camp at the base of the Mountain of Almonds (Jabal al-Lawz).

Joseph Smith, as he was studying the Egyptian papyri in 1835 (the year Lyra Comet 1P appeared in his lifetime), had a scribe decipher some of the Egyptians glyphs on one side of a page, from which an entire narrative would be composed.  Joseph would proclaim that a few glyphs could tell an entire story.  Many scoff at such a claim, but it would seem this was an Egyptian literary (or possibly pedagogical) instrument.  

"Shazer" (rudimentary definition being: Sha [garden] - zer [birth]) is what I would classify as a superword in Nephi's language   The two syllables can tell an entire story: to make haste to a sacred grove of almond trees with a spring of fresh water flowing from a ravine, snow or blossoms dropping like snow or both (early spring), a difficult birth in a garden with an umbilical complication, bright lights in the heavens, a sharp knife, a fire, an anointing, a crown of flowing light, and so on.  This was the birth of Jacob!

If Jewish traditions were followed, the sojourners would remain at least 40 days at this location before continuing the journey.  

##### Shazer as 'dar la luz'
"Bright light" is one significant element in the "Shazer" narrative.  There was a celestial phenomenon in the heavens.  And the birth of Jacob was a celestial miracle on earth.  That is, the birth of a child represents a gift of light and the birthing process can be described as "to give the light" (e.g., Spanish phrase [dar la luz]).

###### Egyptian "sha"

The primary meaning of "sha" in Egyptian is garden, symbolized with a row of trees in the hieroglyph.  A deeper dive into the "sh" worldlist is quite interesting.

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript and its editorialization.

###### Nephi narratives as "sha" wordplay

Now, the wordplay to craft stories is beginning to emerge.  It would seem like the introduction is anchored to the power of the [sh] which is fundamentally the power of woman.  Very interesting indeed.  So are there other [sh] sounds we can piece together to recreate the 1 Nephi narrative?

![Nephi synopsis](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Nephi-synopsis.png?raw=true) *Nephi synopsis*: Nephi synopsis of introduction: Our family traveled into the desert, a parent proposed we (the brothers) return to Jerusalem to acquire the writings.  I will go and do.  I observed the sword was of curious craftsmanship.  … Later, the family of Ishmael joined us and my "Ishtar" became my consummated wife.

![Nephi kills Laban](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Nephi-night.png?raw=true) *Nephi kills Laban*: I will go and do, sneak around the city at night and skillfully kill Laban.


![Lehi's vision](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Lehi.png?raw=true) *Lehi's vision*: A gulf of misery, joy for some, lamentation for others


![Nephi steering boat](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Nephi-boat.png?raw=true) *Nephi steering boat*: I was steering the boat, my brothers designed to mutiny, a tempest arose driving us backward, I was again free, I again was steering the boat to an unknown foreign land 


###### Other Biblical narratives using "sha" wordplay

To ascertain if this wordplay is a common literary device of the ancients, let's consider two additional examples:  one from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament.  As you begin to see the power of the wordplay, you will observe that some words used in one example could have also been used in another example which would give the story an even richer meaning.

![Josiah renovates the temple](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Josiah.png?raw=true) *Josiah renovates the temple*:  Josiah commissions quarry work to renovate the temple, documents and writings are discovered.  Josiah examines these, tears his garments, returns to his palace (office) and is full of grief and sorrow.

![Yeshua considers the Lilies of the Field](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Yeshua.png?raw=true) JYeshua considers the Lilies of the Field*:  To "consider" means to ponder, reflect, engage in the "sapien" dimension of humanity that makes us homo sapiens.  Lilies do NOT engage in such activity, yet have a beauty unsurpassed.

For the uninitiated, the word "sha" can mean garden or field; Solomon's name is tied to the concept of peace "shaw-lawm".  This should be sufficient to enable a literary hunt for a potential alliteration in this remnant of a teaching from Yeshua.  Or possibly some other poetic form.

###### Implications 
There are a few significant implications to this literary wordplay.  First, understanding that they exist enables one to attempt to recraft known stories back into the ancient Egyptian.  Possibly.  This is a rule that can be utilized to start assembling the puzzle.  It is analagous to a corner piece or straight-edge piece.  

Second, maybe [sh] is the first letter of the alphabet.  

Third, does Nephi outline an entire abecedarian on the small plates?  

Fourth, did Mormon implement the literary form AFTER discovering the small plates?  Mormon does attempt to use a phonetic anchor [kh] in one portion of his writings.  This is why the Korihor story seems so disjoint from the main storyline.  And within the [kh] storyline, there are some very odd interjections.  Was Mormon trying his hand at the ancient literary practice?  It would seem that Mormon was not very good at this, so maybe it was new to him.  Or maybe, after he had written his curated summary, he discovered Nephi's literature and was both amazed and humbled.

Finally, the correlation of the broken Hebrew with the broken Egyptian in context of a literary wordplay will enable an iterative process that will inform and update each of the three elements.

Seemingly, the "zer" stem represents the entire conception process: the mixing of fluids to grow a child which breaks forth and is born.  That is, the sowing, the growing, and the breaking forth.  Therefore, as we may say "this person was born to be a consecrated priest", the ancients may say "this person was sown to become a consecrated priest."  If anything, the planting of the seed (consummation leading to conception), is most important in the ancient language: to spring forth or to raise up.  

That is, where Nephi's brother Jacob was breaking forth, Nephi's first-born son may have been planted into a well.  Is it Mor-on-i or Cum-or-yah?  In context of this location, likely Cum-or-yah  (the rising light of Jehovah) was conceived at Shazer.  Mor-on-i (captain of navy) would be more intuitive when the family settles in Southern Arabia and eventually Nephi builds one or more maritime vessels.


###### Egyptian "zer"
Does Egyptian have a "z" sound?  Yes, it seems that early Egyptologists used the "s" to represent two distinct characters:  the "lamad" symbol was one form of "s" and the "two-horizontal knots" was another form of "s" (called a "door bolt" by some) which today has been mapped to the "z" sound.  The same sound in Hebrew is mapped to a symbol that looks like an equal sign and may represent "sweat" as in, the sweat of the brow.  Interestingly, the Egyptian use of "z" seems to activate something inactive, representing the action of "making it so".  That is the "z" symbol prepends to the known: for example, "baq" meaning shiny becomes "z'baq" meaning to make shiny or to cause to be shiny.  That is, by the sweat of the brow, a human acts to make a thing/state.

Interestingly, it has been concluded that the Egyptian language did not have the "l" sound (like lion) which is strange considering the ability to pronounce such a sound is not extremely difficult.  And the "lamad" symbol exists in early Hebrew which produces such a sound.  Was it a cultural omission to focus on Ra by intentionally removing the L from the language system?

At some point in the translation processes, maybe late in history by the Masoretes or maybe after the exile, confusion from lost knowledge seemed to abound.  Consider, for example, the word "to dress with clothes" in Hebrew: [law-bash'] (H3847).  Compare it to the Egyptian words:  [sab-ash] (to get dressed - with help).  The symbol for the lamad "l" in Hebrew is the same as one of the "s" symbols in Egyptian.  It would seem, in the passage of time, the clarity was lost, and sab-ash became law-bash.  Other more advanced deviations seem to be [aw-saw'] (H6213) and [kaw-saw'] (H3640). 

Additionally, the difference of the two "s" symbols in Egyptian may have been age or gender specific.  What looks like a "lamad" may represented folded cloth, so the young (female) "s" may be a simple full-body tunic (thawb/hijab) that they would have worn to cover their bodies whereas the adult (male) "s" may have been a simple clothe/belt around the loins.

![Give birth in a garden](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-Birth.png?raw=true) *Give birth in a garden*:  To make shine and to make pregnant seemed to be very similar in sound.  The pregnancy appears to conclude with a woman squatting (in a garden) allowing the child to break forth.  The "za" and "za't" represent the male and female child respectively.  The "z" symbol seems to represent the union (copulation) that leads to a child.  Or, the penetration of a seed into the earth for a plant.  The seed of man penetrates the well of the woman, and if the woman shows signs after opening her legs and embracing a man, an offspring will (after a time) gush forth.  See Alma 32. 

![Time](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-Time.png?raw=true) *Time*:  Time leads to the birth of a free man, who may engage in war with another free man, may show graciousness in life as a noble man.

![Fire and Water](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-FireWater.png?raw=true) *Fire And Water*:  The fire or flame leads to marital congress, a moment of bliss when the seed is planted.  The gushing forth of water is the process which causes a woman to tremble and shake.


![Yeast and Rejuvenation](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-Misc.png?raw=true) *Yeast and Rejuvenation*:  Yeast is an active ingredient that helps bread rise as a "proper planting" of a man's seed in the woman's well would cause the woman's womb to grow.  Likely, the cakes prepared for the Queen Mother of Heaven in the ancient temple were directly associated with the desires of a betrothed woman to become a mother, an Ishtar.

##### Shazer and the six-hundred year prophecy
About 5 April 608 BC, Jacob is born at the event Nephi describes as "Shazer", meaning the twisting.  The month of April is known for the Lyrid meteor showers.  Chinese "star gazers" first recorded observing these meteor showers from Lyra in ~686 BC.  They first observed a meteorite hitting the earth in ~643 BC.  So what exactly was seen in the heavens, in the stars, when Jacob was born?

Lyra Comet 1P already appeared in the heavens about five years earlier.  Was there a supernova event at this time?  Did a meteorite strike the top of the Mountain creating a fire, a new "Sinai" event?  
We do not know exactly.  We do know that the 1 Nephi narrative never mentions stars which is indeed strange given the context of their travels in Arabia.  Maybe "Shazer" represents a cartouche-of-sorts clarifying that the heavens were filled with signs and wonders.  Regardless, Lyra Comet 1P was a warning to Jerusalem that begin the chaos that led to the family being isolated in the desert at the Mount of Almonds for Jacob to be born at this sacred place.  The mountain of all mountains.  A place where Abraham (and Moses) and Joshua already communed with the heavens.  A place where Yeshua and Muhammad would later commune with the heavens.  A sacred cross roads for Abraham located in the land of his six youngest sons:  the Midians.

Samuel the Lamanite clarified that the Messianic birth would be declared by a supernova five years after seeing the cyclical appearance of Lyra Comet 1P.  Does that mean the six-hundred year prophecy had a similar, two-stage anchor of reference?  The pattern seems to be:  Lyra Comet 1P creates speculation and wonder by observers (of all ages) and then something happens thereafter.  

Consider the comet's appearance in April 1066.  Speculation abounded by locals that there was a succession crisis in Britain.  William of Normandy leveraged this phenomenon to invade Britain in October and thereafter the Normans controlled much of Britain until 1154 when Henry II became an undisputed British monarch.

For the people of Nephi in America, certainly this cyclical phenomenon would be observed.  Similarly, the question can be posed if the Hebrew nation had observed this phenomenon previously in their history.

#### Cycles of 60 and 75
A 60-year cycle, the cycle of the return of the Water Ox can be anchored to the year 8 BC.  A 75-year cycle, the cycle of the return of Lyra Comet 1P can be anchored to the year 12 BC.  From those anchors, we can review the past and future, to ascertain any significant historical change points.  Of note is the fact that these cycles will coincide (plus or minus a few years) every 300 years:  60 × 5 = 75 × 4.

The 60-year cycle is purely mathematical so will not have any deviations.   Anchoring to a solar equinox as a New Year (Nowruz), the passage of time is easy to measure.  However, the appearance of some initial signs in the heavens that led to speculation (that then led to Samuel the Lamanite entering frame and preaching), indicates a cycle with uncertainty.  That is, the 75-year cycle of Lyra Comet 1P.

The people of Nephi considered the age of a man to be about 72 years, why was this?  Was it because the founder [ni] lived to this age?  Or was it anchored to the cyclical nature of this comet?  Or maybe both?

![Lyra Comet 1P: 75-year cycle with deviations
](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/Lyra-trend.png?raw=true) *Lyra Comet 1P: 75-year cycle with deviations*

The trend of the comet is rather consistent after the appearance immediately preceding the Messianic birth.  There appears to be a sinusoidal deviation around a simple linear trend:  On average, every 75 years, the comet appears 2.1 years later.  In 20 cycles (1500 years later), the deviation would be 42 years according to the estimated trend and actual observation.  This trend does not help astrological speculation before the Messianic birth.  However, given its importance at the onset of the story for the family of Nephi, it would be carefully monitored and documented.  

##### Colon-mbia: the 2100-year prophecy
The 2100-year prophecy was very likely part of the legend of Nephi found on the small plates.  If you can recognize the 1830s puffery about Columbus coupled with the anti-semitic sentiment, the elements of editorialization can be examined.

- Colon (or Colom) was the name prophesied.  In a historical document, this is unprecedented (a smoking gun for the veracity of the Ancient American Record).  What is objectively laudable would be laughable in 1830s America.  So the name is removed from the prophecy.
- Colon was Jewish: a man among Gentiles.  In mathematics, the current language could imply either a Jew or Gentile, but given Colon's life and commentary about the Ancient Americans (look, they are clean-shaven and circumcised, all of them), Colon was Jewish during the Iberian era of the Inquisition.  Likely born in Barcelona, a member of the Colom family, the man made every effort to dissociate himself with his heritage.  What was his first name?  Well, to fit in, Cristóbal or Cristoforo is a nice Christian choice.  Careful analysis of any original texts we have will demonstrate examples of phrases from the Catalan language.  But of course, all of his original journals were curated and editorialized by Bartolomé de las Casas.  And, Colom commissioned his good friend to help craft a Christian theophany about the Crusades in the Holy Land.  And, Colom's sons on his death bed begged to know their true heritage, a secret Colom took to the grave.  Just imagine if the Mormon movement, even today, would anchor to this frame.
- Colon-mbia literally means the arrival of Colon.  A fulfillment of the apocalyptic prophecy of Nephi:  in 2100 years, ships from the east (using our ship-building technology) will arrive and KILL YOU ALL.  Kafkaesque.  This is a very intriguing prophecy in essence.  Yet is shrowded with sunshine and rainbows:  Colon was inspired to come to this land and KILL YOU ALL; these liberated Gentiles were not all bad, they were seeking religious freedom so they came to America to KILL YOU ALL.  After the lens of editorialization is applied, the inconsistencies can be removed so serious discussion can follow.
    - Nephi described this event to his children with a name and a timeframe: Colon will arrive (Colon-mbia) in 2100 years after Shazer (~1493).  Children would be ripped from their mothers and their heads smashed against brick homes; your daughters will be raped until sores/callouses develop; your efforts to negotiate and find commonality (your God visited us and this is what He taught) will result in torturous deaths.  What will you do?
        - Option 1: we fight.  The original voyage of Colon was a disaster.  The three captains had different objectives, one was interested in prioritizing rape and returned to Europe dying shortly thereafter from syphilis.  The other two ships were summarily defeated, Colon's ship was forced onto a reef and sunk.  A careful reading of the Doctor's diary on the second voyage reveals the official narrative of men left behind to secure a fort is pure fiction.  Taking a few slave girls for ravaging, they returned to Europe.  Not Spain.  Colon arrived in Portugal as he wanted to avoid the financiers of his lost vessel.  Within six months, they were able to return to America with 17 ships and 1500 men.  And these slave girls were also useful for understanding a local 'lingua franca' that made communication with very distinct tribes possible through the Americas.  The maritime superioty that defeated Colon was never encountered again.  Although Colon actively looked for them.  They were gone.
		Option 2: we flight.  The above story is a hit-and-run, almost a scouting party.  After the encounter, this group likely went North to warn their cousins in Cahokia.  Maybe other messengers went South to warn the locals there as well.  And the flight to isolation began.  The people of Marajo vanish in the archeology.  Tairona and Machu Pichu seems to be the highlands-isolation strategy.  Another group blocks the Cayenne River (Cuyarí) by chopping down large trees to damn access upstream; the Portuguese would name this river Madeira (meaning wood).
		Option 3: we fade to white.  The Americas may have had over 100 million people in 1491.  Most have painted the population desolation as an American Holocaust; that is, the killing and disease decimated the populations.  One interesting study among the Maya, however, suggests that the locals may have chose to stop having children.  Given the prophecy, to you want to be enslaved by the greedy colonists for generations, or do you just want to live a nice laugh, watch the sunset with your loved ones, and fade to white.
		Option 4: we proselyte.  The Book of Mormon is replete with stories of brave missionaries proselyting among their enemies.  The civilization was advanced, had the capability of trans-oceanic travel, and so this option was also likely exercised by some.  Maybe several different efforts.  Where did the Vikings come from?  How about the Anglo-Saxons?  Or the Franks?  Were these groups from America that decided to take the ministry to Europe: to build a society like Nephi did that would protect the innocent?
		Option 5: we embrace the blight.  One woodcarving suggests that suicide was a way out.  One example was a depiction of a beautiful, tall, naked blond woman that took a club and beat her daughter to death, told her boy to run off into the woods, and then hung herself.  Maybe this could be classified as a "flight", but maybe not.  Others would meet with the conquistadores trying to persuade them knowing hoping to bring out the goodness of men.  How many times did an initial meet-and-greet turn into a hostage situation?  This option is to embrace the blight as a learning experience.  To endure, bearing the burdens that were required, so that the prophecy of the scattering and the remnant would be fulfilled.  "All" was not absolute, a remnant of the descendants of Nephi exists today.  Because they chose to embrace the blight.
		Option 6: rebel out of spite.  It could be understandable how some would see this impending outcome as a curse for living in a society crafted by Nephi.  Such people may revert to other practices, may utilize knowledge about the details of the Messiah Death Event and hunt down and torture faithful believers in similar ways:  forcing a good man to copulate with your sister before bashing his head in with a club, cutting a good man's throat from ear-to-ear on the altar of a temple, severely mutilating the genitalia of a man before castrating, and forcing family and friends to eat the flesh of their fathers (Moroni 9).

	- The people of Nephi, in an effort to thwart the inevitable, may have enabled it.  Maybe they wrecked a ship along the Iberian coastline.  Or maybe, in a missionary effort, they arrived in port to meet with the local kings.  King John of Portugual seeminly decided to use this design to plunder, starting with North Africa in 1415.  Thereafter a school of navigation was developed and the explorations of Portuguese were kept secret.  Likely the cyclical tradewinds of 30-degrees south were understood as the Brasilian land was discovered.  Almost, as if, they were given clues by seasoned explorers.  The ship was a game-changing technology as it could carry lots of plunder, had thick timbers for war, and were extremely sturdy in poor weather and still reasonably fast (although not agile).  The Portuguese would call this ship the Não, which the Muslims being plundered named it the "qaraqir" (the dread of the merchant ports, literally the wall-buster:  qara-qir = tear to pieces [H7167] - walls [H7023]) which became standardized as the carraca and carrack.  The caravel was a modified version with a shallower draft and more manueverable.  A radical innovation that turned the peaceful Indian Ocean into a zone of piracy.  Portugal would pillage and later claim they were establishing free trade (at extortionary prices).  When, in fact, they ended a free-trade zone that was successful and collaborative for over 2000 years!
	- Colon arrives in America and notices how friendly the locals are and how willing they are to exchange goods for glass beads or seashells.

According to a different Chinese record, a comet appeared in the autumn of 614 BC (Table II, [https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1982JBAA...92..209B]).  Given the limited data, we may reasonably conclude that this comet was also Lyra 1P.




#### Cycles of 50 and 75







If so, the people of Nephi would have likely tracked each occurrence of the cyclical appearance of this comet.  Since the cyclical appearance fluctuates, maybe the data varied within 72-78 year window.  Using modern engineering notation, we would say 75 ± 3 years to capture the uncertainty. 



If we take Samuel's words as "5 years exactly", a supernova occuring on 5 April 8 BC would necessitate a lesser-yet-primary sign to occur on 5 April 13 BC.  This primary sign was not a unique, one-off event, rather it was cyclical.  As such, this celestial event can be used to keep track of time.  From earth, it would appear like a moving star that appears and disappears.

Comets are celestial bodies that appear to be moving lights 

One of the most famous phenomenon we call the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.

The evidence points to Jesus being born in the period 5 BC March 9 - May 4, probably around Passover time: 5 BC April 13-27. Birth in the spring is consistent with the account in Luke that there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flock by night. Birth in 5 BC is also consistent with the census of Caesar Augustus. The date of the Nativity presented here enables a new chronology of the life of Christ to be constructed which is consistent with the available evidence.

Out of Lyra is a celestial body that appears every 75 years or so.


Recall that both narratives (Herod and Samuel the Lamanite) indicate there were many celestial signs.  Maybe this could be associated with annual meteor showers.  However, as discussed, an ultimate sign of the Messianic birth was a supernova.  And this occurred after a significant primary sign.  


NASA has data on various heavenly events, and many of those are cyclical which means they can be estimated if not recorded or referenced in wrriten observations.  During the family journey described in 1 Nephi, there was an unusual cluster of solar/lunar eclipses with totalities visible within the Arabian peninsula.  In addition, a famous comet may have appeared during that time frame (Astophysicists use the cyclical nature of the comet and estimates sightings that are not readily available in written documents).

One of the most famous phenomenon we call the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.  I will give it a more time-honored name, the Comet Lyra or Comet 1P from Lyra.  Joseph Smith observed this phenomenon in 1835 and discussed it as an important sign and wonder of the heavens (and Mark Twain even has a unique relationship with this comet).  The comet Lyra has a cycle (shaw-nah, H8138) that is approximately 75 years: more or less depending on whether the comet gets close to a planet when it enters the planetary region of the solar system and is effected by local gravity.  In addition, the mass of the comet would likely be reduced over time as it emits a stream of material which could possibly create a time trend. 

##### Comet and Shazer 
So maybe the 600-year prophecy was anchored to, or computed from,  the appearance of this comet?  "Bright light" is one meaning of "Shazer" representing both a celestial phenomenon in the heavens as well as the celestial miracle on the earth: the birth of a child as a gift of light (e.g., [dar la luz] in Spanish: a crown of flowing light, see H2213 H2215 H2224 H2225 and so on).  Maybe part of "Shazer" was the appearance 




 and would be composed of three seasons of four months  

, of which, there are many descriptions in ancient China: 


This aligns with a Chinese celebration of Qingming: bright lights, sweeping the tombs of the ancestors, and a vague master-servant relationship.  




 Such a holiday would be anchored to an ancient solar calendar commonly used by agrariain populations known as the four-quarters calendar (四時八節曆):   


This aligns with a Chinese celebration of Qingming: bright lights, sweeping the tombs of the ancestors, and a vague master-servant relationship.  The Chinese had a four-pillars calendar based exclusively on the sun, but the modern lunar-solar calendar will suffice to demonstrate that 8 BC is the year of the Water Ox.  









Joseph Smith declared that the Messiah was born 6 April.  My mathematical frame places the year to be 8 BC.  So did a supernova occur at that time?









Since a supernova is a one-time, non-cyclical event, the historical record is the only source of potential events.  The earliest record of a supernova that we currently have is from the year 185 AD when the Chinese noted a "guest star" appeared.  Other potential candidates from Chinese tradition may include:  ~1300 BC, and 532 BC.  In addition, Chinese observed that the meteor showers from Lyra began about 686 BC with the first observed meteorite hitting the earth in 643 BC.





 (labeled Tycho's supernova).  The second occurred in 1604 (labeled Kepler's supernova).

So the bright light would over time dim and present itself as a new star in the heavens.   The luminosity makes a star visible to the human eye ..


 That is, the star is dying, and its explosion is a key change point in the death process. 



Joseph Smith emphasized


Some (such as Johannes Kepler) would later consider the possibility that the "new star" appearing in the East was the result of a supernova.  Joseph Smith concluded that 6 April was the date of the event.

So, can we find evidence for a supernova event that occurred on 6 April 8 BC?    

 That is, the local peoples knew of the six-hundred year prophecy.  Samuel clarifies that the speculative trigger, which I will label the primary sign, had occurred.   After a few more years (recorded in the editorialized Book of Mormon as precisely 5 years), another sign would be given to commemorate the Messianic birth.  This sign I will label the ultimate sign.









Many traditions suggest that the child was approximately two years old when the wise men finally meet the Messiah.   

Other traditions change the order, that the wise men meet the family and Messianic child in Alexandria Egypt when the child is about four years old.  The wise men may have returned home or they may have spent the remainder of their lives with the child, possibly helping educate the child.  (Recall, that at the age of 12, the Messiah appears in the temple answering questions and amazes the teachers therein.)  The number of wise men is also unknown, with three (or four) being the common number as it represents the number of gifts offered.  Local traditions suggest there may have been as many as 12 wise men.

Looping through the 60-year cycles defined as big years:  1793, 1853, 1913, 1973, 2033 would represent the thirtieth to thirty-fourth big years.  Maybe these are important anchors representing milestones: the age of modern freedom (French Republic Constitution), the age of modern science (physics, chemistry, and so on), the age of modern war (WWI, institution banking), the age of social awakening (Roe v. Wade, Nixon visits China, sexual revolution), and finally the age of the celestial big reveal (e.g., Close Encounters of the Third Kind).


Anchoring to a Chinese meaning of a Water Ox that aligns well with Hebrew meaning, I conclude that the Messiah was born 8 BC.  The 60-year cycle could be classified as a big year.  The 33rd big year occurred in 1973; and the 34th big year will occur in 2033. 

1913, 1853, 1793 


Interestingly, the Water Ox is preceded (12 years earlier) by a Metal Ox (辛丑年: [industrious] + [two-knife]) which is possibly the year of Nephi's birth (20 BC) as the great KHERESH.  In addition, the Water Ox is succeeded (12 years later) by a Wood Ox (乙丑年: [second position] + [two-knife]) which is the year of Joseph Smith's birth in 1805.

 

##### Birth dates: the Messiah and Nephi's brother Jacob 
The Book of Mormon prophesy as presented was precise, 600 years.  Certainly the Messianic birth is part of the prophecy.  What is the other anchor exactly?  Was it also a birth?  If so, who was born?  If we accept the Christian narrative at face value, there was a new star in the heavens appearing before the Messianic birth: a star in the east and wonders in the heavens.  The interchange between Herod and the "wise men" may suggest that many, many celestial events were occuring, so it was difficult to ascertain which sign was the prophetic one.

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript and its editorialization.

##### Shazer: Jacob is born at the Mountain of Almonds (aka Sinai)
My current understanding is that the word "Shazer" was the marker of the 600 year prophecy.  It represented the birth of Jacob, Nephi's younger brother.  And at his birth, there were many signs in the heavens.  "Shazer" (rudimentary definition being: Sha [garden] - zer [birth]) is what I would classify as a superword in Nephi's language (which interestingly Joseph Smith described when discussing Egyptian later in his life: one or two symbols could tell an entire story).  The two word stems can tell an entire story, and this was a teaching device: a sacred grove of almond trees, early spring, snow or blossoms dropping like snow or both, a difficult birth in a garden with an umbilical complication, a sharp knife, a fire, and so on.  This was the birth of Jacob!

#### Synchronizing Dates

If we can calculate when the family left Jerusalem, then we would know what year the Messiah was born.  And vice versa.  

For example, the family can easily move within/without the city walls, so this puts a constraint on the potential year - the city could not be under seige.  The city of Jerusalem was destroyed about 586 BC during a second siege of the city; the first seige occurred about 605 BC.

Next, the data of Samuel the Lamanite regarding the Messianic birth offers another boundary condition.  Many signs already had appeared and Samuel clarified that the ultimate sign would occur a few years after the primary sign.  So what was the primary sign?  And, what would the ultimate sign be?

##### Celestial anchor: Lyra Comet 1P as the primary sign 
NASA has data on various heavenly events, and many of those are cyclical which means they can be estimated if not recorded or referenced in wrriten observations.  During the family journey described in 1 Nephi, there was an unusual cluster of solar/lunar eclipses with totalities visible within the Arabian peninsula.  In addition, a famous comet may have appeared during that time frame (Astophysicists use the cyclical nature of the comet and estimates sightings that are not readily available in written documents).

One of the most famous phenomenon we call the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.  I will give it a more time-honored name, the Comet Lyra or Comet 1P from Lyra.  Joseph Smith observed this phenomenon in 1835 and discussed it as an important sign and wonder of the heavens (and Mark Twain even has a unique relationship with this comet).  The comet Lyra has a cycle (shaw-nah, H8138) that is approximately 75 years: more or less depending on whether the comet gets close to a planet when it enters the planetary region of the solar system and is effected by local gravity.  In addition, the mass of the comet would likely be reduced over time as it emits a stream of material which could possibly create a time trend. 

##### Comet and Shazer 
So maybe the 600-year prophecy was anchored to, or computed from,  the appearance of this comet?  "Bright light" is one meaning of "Shazer" representing both a celestial phenomenon in the heavens as well as the celestial miracle on the earth: the birth of a child as a gift of light (e.g., [dar la luz] in Spanish: a crown of flowing light, see H2213 H2215 H2224 H2225 and so on).  Maybe part of "Shazer" was the appearance of this comet and the prophesy recorded by Lehi was something like: this sign in the heaven will appear eight more times in the next six hundred years (75 x 8 = 600); then, a new star will appear; and then, the Messiah will be born.


##### Cultural Implications of Lyra Comet 1P
If so, the people of Nephi would have likely tracked each occurrence of the cyclical appearance of this comet.  Since the cyclical appearance fluctuates, maybe the data varied within 72-78 year window.  Using modern engineering notation, we would say 75 ± 3 years to capture the uncertainty. 

The people of Nephi considered the age of a man to be about 72 years, why was this?  Was it because the founder [ni] lived to this age?  Or was it anchored to the cyclical nature of this comet?  Again, one must read each number judiciously:  maybe Joseph originally voiced 75 which ultimately was recorded as 72.  Any literal reading should be done cautiously given the nature of the translation process (with or without any editorialization).

And the cosmic cycle of the comet would seem to continue to be an important sign of the heavens for the Ancient Americans.  Maybe it was part of the 2100-year "Colon-mbia" prediction.  This presents the possibility that "Colon-mbia" was also a timed prophecy of 2100 years: 600 + 600 + 600 + 300 = 28 cycles of 75 = 35 cycles of 60.  

Cahokia seems to have been established around 1066 (a final gathering of the cousins) and then disbanded after 1441 (well before Colon-mbia in 1492).  Archeologists have confirmed that many other Ancient American groups (e.g., Marajoara)  disappeared from large lowland cities within the timeframe of 75 years before 1492.  Speculations abound if these groups migrated to isolated locations (the safety of remote highlands in significant jungle) or if they merely chose not to continue having children (negative birth rate) or a combination of both.

##### Other Potential Cultural Implications of Lyra Comet 1P

It has been well established in history that Lyra Comet 1P was used as rational for explaining political events and outcomes.  For example, the Battle of Hastings in 1066 followed the comet's appearance which many at the time associated with England's succession crisis.  

Maybe the Hebrew tradition had similar familiarity with this comet before the "Shazer" era.  And if the celestial events of Nephi's life were similar to celestial events occuring when the Messiah was born, additional insights can be considered.  That is, "Shazer" may have been an ultimate event .




#### Six-hundred year prophecy 
To clarify the six-hundred year prophecy, we need to consider the potential relevance of the comet.  According to our understanding of one historical Chinese astronomical record, a comet believed to be Lyra 1P appeared in 12 BC (26 August - 20 October).  This would be an anchor for the Messianic birth, as it is in the neighborhood for an appropriate date.  So, did this same comet also appear in 612 BC?   According to a different Chinese record, a comet appeared in the autumn of 614 BC (Table II, [https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1982JBAA...92..209B]).  Given the limited data, we may reasonably conclude that this comet was also Lyra 1P.

Anchored to our current temporal assumptions of a solar year (365.2422 days per year), the two appearances occurred a little over 600 years apart: maybe 602 years, two and a half months.  Should we conclude that the  prophecy was literally that number, or was the prophecy anchored to the appearance of the cyclical Lyra 1P Comet with its deviations?  What did Joseph original voice?  That is, if Joseph voiced 602 years, would Sidney have edited the number to 600 based on his knowledge of biblical numerology, specifically the story of Noah?  It is worth noting that no one on the editorial staff for the Book of Mormon (or in the inner circle of the early Church) had significant mathematical prowess.


##### Samuel the Lamanite: add 5 years  
Next, consider the data we can derive from story of Samuel the Lamanite.  Celestial events were being observed.  And, if Comet Lyra 1P was part of the prophecy, it would be considered to be an important marker.  Likely, Samuel used the appearance of the comet to remind the people of the entire prophesy.    Maybe Samuel the Lamanite did indeed say 5 years.  If so, did that mean exactly 5 years?  Or within 5 years?  Maybe Samuel said exactly 3 years and 7 months?  Or maybe "15 days after the fourth vernal equinox from now" which cardinally be anchored to a fifth?   If the published does deviate from the actual, cCompounding what Joseph understood was voiced coupled with his team's understanding of ancient time counting and its accompanying mathematics, the question would remain:  what was the exact motivation for such an editorialization? 


##### The ultimate sign of the Messianic birth  
And what precisely was the official sign of the Messianic birth: a night without darkness (that would be visible globally, not just hemispherically)?  The description may suggest the new star was a supernova event (Kepler held this belief) or a two-star-merging anova.  Did Joseph Smith or his editorial staff know of Kepler's estimation and work this detail into the narrative?  Or did Joseph receive an ancient narrative about Samuel the Lamanite, from which, editorialization may occur?


#### Times and Seasons:  Bookends of the Messianic Life 
Intersecting all available data, I currently conclude that the Messianic birth occurred 5 April 8 BC.  Or maybe 6 April based on Joseph Smith's statement.  This aligns with a Chinese celebration of Qingming: bright lights, sweeping the tombs of the ancestors, and a vague master-servant relationship.  The Chinese had a four-pillars calendar based exclusively on the sun, but the modern lunar-solar calendar will suffice to demonstrate that 8 BC is the year of the Water Ox.  And interestingly, this coincides with the year -600 in the Bengali calendar.

Joseph Smith was a Wood Ox 


##### Year of the Water Ox 
The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".

##### Traditional Challenges to a date earlier than 6BC
Many would dismiss such an early birth year based on Herod-death constraints.  One needs to carefully consider how little we know of the actual story as the narratives we have all have gone through significant editorialization for two millenia.  We have a character Herod who was observing many significant celestial signs.  We have wise men that were seeking to interact with the Messianic family.  Yeshua had to be born; at 8 days Yeshua had to be named and circumcised (was this a Lotus birth?); at 40 days Mary would have been able to present herself at the temple.  Given the interchange between Herod and the wise men, Herod orders all male under the age of 2 to be killed in the region.  Mary/Joseph lived in Nazareth, but Yeshua born in Bethlehem.  The family was warned of Herod's wicked heart and fled to Egypt, likely Alexandria.  At some point the wisemen encountered the family, most suggest this occurred before the family left for Egypt.  As one iterates through the implications of the life and death of the Messiah, all of this data may need to be carefully reconsidered.  Are the order of events literal and accurate?  Was Herod, a Hasmonean that was restoring Hebrew convenants within the Abrahamic tradition, a bad guy?  Are you capable of seeing how the narrative could have been manipulated to paint the Jewish leader as the bad guy so the Roman leadership could be identified as good guys, or at least neutral (washing their hands of the Messianic death)?




So if the Messianic birth was 5 April 8 BC, when was the Messianic death?  This birth anchor is earlier than most would allow given traditions of when the death occurred and the Herod-death constraints.  Again, assuming the Christian tradition at face value (there are also obvious motivations for editorialization), the wisemen encountered the young Yeshua in Alexandria, Egypt when the boy was about 4 years old.  The Herod timeline could work.




##### Numerology of the Perfect Life: The Christ Number 33
Most also believe that 33 is the perfect Christ number and that he lived to be exactly 33 years.  Tradition is that the Messiah was born 1 AD and died 34 AD.  Most scholars place the Messiah Death Event in the 30-33 AD range.  Which is precisely the range we find in 3 Nephi.  

My calculations have Yeshua being born 5 April 8 BC and dying 5 May 31 AD, living 37 years, 30 days.  Not a full 40 years, but more than 30 years: fulfilling a Jewish tradition.  And interestingly, Joseph Smith when he was that age was pondering death.  In January 1843, Joseph gave a sermon focusing on an Old Testament reference that we as God's pinnacle of creation will one day feed the grasses of the field.

##### Impasse: In the 33rd and 34th year ...
Anchored to a belief of exactness within the Book of Mormon, I was at an impasse. All I had was a comment by scholar Royal Skousen when he concluded from his lifetime of study that "Oliver was tricky."  This means that, according to Royal, Oliver Cowdery would make edits to the manuscript and Joseph kept having to review the work to make certain this did NOT continue.  But now, given that Sidney or Oliver may have intentionally manipulated a few dates to fit their internal belief systems, I could look for a Messiah Death date independent of the constraint found in 3 Nephi.

So the various data all aligned very nicely with the exception of 3 Nephi.  A review of the limited data we have, curated by Royal Skousen, shows that the scribes had crossed-out and replaced at least one date in 3 Nephi.  Maybe to align with Sidney's belief that the Messiah lived a perfect life of 33 years, born 1 AD and died 34 AD (an anchor James Talmage would use in his framing of Jesus the Christ).  
My anchors for the birth/death of the Messiah are from a seemingly uninvolved third party:  China.  Qingming occurs 15 days after the equinox on April 5th-ish and means the celebration of the bright lights or pure lights where the living sweep the tombs of their ancestors (possibly preparing them for a promised ressurrection), the year 8BC is my proposal as the origin of the holiday is unknown (conflated with other holiday, traditions, and stories).  I associate this to the supernova predicting the birth of the Messiah.  

And the death anchored to the observation of a solar eclipse with totality visible in the Sea of Japan, 5 May 31 AD.

### Personal reflection in the limit 
Being raised in the Mormon tradition, it was very difficult to challenge one's own internal belief system.  For me personally, the mathematics was undeniable.  But what are the consequences?  Again, I think about the consequences also in a maths frame.  What is the finite state of the system?  I experience cognitive dissonance, I realize my internal belief system is flawed.  So what do I do?  I could play the Dehlin card and spend the rest of my life feeding the flames of real feelings of perceived betrayal.  Where does that road lead?  What is the finite state of that choice?  Living an angry, bitter life.  No, thank you.

So a mathematician will extend and abstract the consequences before settling on a finite state machine.  The Mormon Church institution manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  Once you get on that train, the conclusions are obvious:  The Christian institution formalized by Constantine and reformed ever since has manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  The Masoretic tradition of Jewish thought manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Now consider the four domains of life: physical (health), education, religion, government/economics as defined by Luke 2:52.  I have outlined just the religious dimension of institutional manipulation.  And for this treatise, let's stay focused on the religious domain although the implications obviously flow into the other three.

Once you conclude that institutions manage information for Ciceran purposes (grow and self-preserve), layering of belief needs to be deconstructed and redeveloped:  my Mormon traditions, the underlying Judeo-Christian traditions, and the underlying American-British-Roman traditions.  Nephi was wise when he observes how the "traditions of the fathers" can easily blind us.

If you distill these realities, the obvious conclusion is that the Messiah Death Event was very significant.  Why else would the Masoretes manipulate the original Passover tradition and invent the golden calf narrative which was non-existent in the Greek Septuagint?  Why would the polytheistic Roman society have a mother-son adopt such a minor monotheistic religion if there was not reason (data we do not currently have) to motivate such adoption?  Interestingly, the best source document we have to unlock the truth about the Messiah Death Event is the Book of Mormon, with all of its editorial editions and flaws.

#### Anchor of Faith: 3 days of darkness 
The anchor remains:  3 Nephi says there was 3 days of darkness whereas Christian tradition defines only 3 hours of darkness.  Certainly Sidney would have known the 3-hour tradition yet the 3-day innovation was included.  Maybe this was something Sidney edited, Oliver implemented, and Joseph Smith corrected.  Those details would be fascinating.

Regardless, why did the polemics of the Mormon movement NOT anchor to this obvious difference?  Why was faith not exercised in the literal words of 3 Nephi.  3 days of darkness!  What can cause 3 days of darkness throughout the world?  The answer is obvious: multiple volcanic eruptions that filled the skies with ash. 

And for the modern Mormon institution, what I describe as the Brigham Synod (the culture of my upbringing), where is the strong stance on this very obvious distinction?  Why is the difference avoided or apologized away?  Talk about the ultimate "click-bait" for a modern discussion:  Mormon Church doubles down on 3 Nephi description of three-days of darkness calling Western traditions of Roman history pure fiction! 

This was the anchor of faith from which Mormonism could have thrived to fulfill the promise of Isaiah:  that the knowledge of Jehovah would fill the world like the waters fill the sea.  Apologists seem to want to make this data point disappear rather than anchor and pivot from it.  If Roman tradition says there was 3 hours of darkness and Nephi tradition says there was 3 days of darkness, who should you believe?  An uninvolved witness half way around the world, or a society directly involved with the Messiah Death Event?

Aha!  Can you see?

###### Implications for Romans crafting history
This unlocks the obvious conclusion that the Romans intentionally lied about the details of the Messiah Death Event, which, in turn, will challenge any detail in Roman history after Julius Caesar:  when did the Pompeii destruction occur?  when and how did Tiberius and Caligula die?

The Messiah Death Event was much worse than you can imagine.  More brutal for those tortured AND the Apocalyptic Celestial Response *was* Epic.  There are plenty of clues remaining to this reality, a trinity of triangulating testimonies:  Psalms (20-24), Isaiah (20-24), and Matthew (20-24).  Rome does not recover to take the city of Jerusalem until 70 AD (soldiers die, power structures are destabilized), Roman "historians" begin recrafting a narrative in 100 AD:  Josephus to develop messaging for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger to develop messaging for a Roman audience.


##### The Messiah Death Event
The death likely occurred on 5 May 31 AD.  There was a solar eclipse over the Japan Sea on that day; the Emperor of China observed the occurence, proclaimed a "Son of the heavens has died" and entered his palace [in mourning] for 5 days.  There was an airburst event over Jerusalem that turned stones on the temple's altar to chalkstone.  This event likely created shockwaves that archaelogists associate with a magnitude 6+ earthquake with an epicenter in the middle of the Dead Sea.  The water level of the Dead Sea immediately dropped 50 feet.  Lilies of the field were decimated according to pollen data replaced by flora that can survive in a more arid environment.  Hearty oliveyards and vineyards suffer and rebound.  Trees that trigger seeding after fire-events (pines and pistachios) flourish.  And so on.  


If the Book of Mormon is literally true, why has the Mormon Church never double-downed on the distinction of 3 days NOT 3 hours? Now, as I reflect on my journey, I have concluded that during the Joseph Smith era, everyone understood that Joseph as Prophet received novel content that was organized into the Book of Mormon with the help of his scribes.  If true, such an objective anchor would NOT be so objective for those living in that era.  

But what of the modern movement?  Does it also have knowledge that such a distinction (3 days, not 3 hours) may have been an editorialization?  

Regardless, stepping forward with faith that the 3 days of darknesses was not edited by Oliver or Sidney, the implications are tremendous.  

And that, my dear reader, is the seed needed to move forward.  To reconstruct your understanding of the Messiah Death Event.  To unlock how instutitions manipulate you to thrive and grow:  in healthcare, in education, in religion, in government/economics/politics.  To enable you to understand the purpose of this planet [mor-mon-ya] and your celestial heritage.

Godspeed.  Namaste.
