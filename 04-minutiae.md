## Behind the mathematician's curtain 
Many times a mathematician working on a proof does NOT reveal the minutiae that led to the distilled essence and result.  So, it can be difficult to understand "how" one arrived at that conclusion which led to a search for a mathematical proof.  For me, an independent study of the times and seasons associated with the birth and death of the Messiah in association to the numbers provided in the Book of Mormon was the key data that has put me on a path of rediscovery challenging my internal belief systems; at the time, this dilemna led me to consider if Oliver was tricky:  could Oliver have intentionally changed numbers to fit his belief system that would disrupt my calculations?  

### Six-hundred year anchor
For me, the anchor point is the number 600. 

As I disclose my process, please understand that it was non-linear, recursive, and iterative.  My effort to describe it requires taking the complex process of learning and placing the result into a linear frame.

The six hundred year prophecy is anchored to the birth of the Messiah.  And an event associated with Nephi's family when leaving the area of Jerusalem for the deserts of Arabia.

The number 600 in mathematics has embedded within the first perfect number, 6.  Some key ways of arriving at 600 are:  60 × 10; 75 x 8; 50 x 12; 100 x 6.  The story of Noah references the number 600.  Preliminary calculations anchored to year 0 (mathematician's dating system) for the Messianic birth:  Nephi's family around 600 BC, maybe Muhammad around 600 AD (hijra was 622 AD).  Other Abrahamic markers may include:  Abraham, Joseph in Egypt, and/or Moses.  Maybe the great Buddha was born at some point within this special cycle (e.g., 1800 BC), not limiting the pattern to only Abrahamic tradition.

#### Sixty-year Chinese Cycle 
The Chinese have a 60 year cycle (干支) that may be considered a "big year" based on the heaven stems (12) and the earth stems (5) which are decomposed of 5 elements (五行 wuxing): Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood (and the duality of the yin-yang, so technically 120).  

Every 60 years, 5 earth stems pass through 12 heaven stems where the heaven stems are today associated with an animal and an etiological story of a race describes the order of the 12 animals.  The first animal is the Rat, followed by the Ox.  The Ox gave the Rat a ride for a large portion of the race and either the Rat deceived the Ox to win OR the Ox allowed the Rat to win ('you go a head'). 

The symbol for the number 10 in Chinese is the same symbol as the original [tav] of Ancient Hebrew, the symbol of the cross.  The Roman Numeral was merely a rotation of [+] to form an [X].  Six hundred years would be 10 big years; that is 10 cycles of sixty years.

#### Hebrew truth 
In Hebrew, the word for truth/justice/stability consists of three Hebrew letters [amt] (אֱמֶת) where aleph represents a cow, mem represents water (and the chaos of a low-point), and tav represents the cross.  Altogether this may represent the Messianic purpose.

The Messiah may represent a Water Ox that bears a cross, connecting the chronology of the Chinese with the belief that the Messiah would show a way back to the celestial (see John 14:6).  Following traditional Christian anchors, the Messiah was Yeshua.  Yeshua had a cousin, commonly called the Baptist, that would be the precursor for Yeshua:  possibly named Yaḥyā.

#### Water Ox preceded by Water Rat 
The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".  This may represent the Messiah.

The year before the Water Ox is the year of the Water Rat (壬子年]):  [scholar] + [child/progeny] (seed/egg) + [bend-one-ten] (year).   An obvious interpretation could be the "year where a scholar is a seed for one to follow".  That is, the one to precede the Messiah, a cousin that would be a scholar linking the wisdom of the celestial with the learning of men on earth.

Around the year 0, the closest possible year of the Water Ox is 8 BC.  An anchor for the birth of the Messiah.  




Will it work with historical norms and  
















Looping through the 60-year cycles defined as big years:  1793, 1853, 1913, 1973, 2033 would represent the thirtieth to thirty-fourth big years.  Maybe these are important anchors representing milestones: the age of modern freedom (French Republic Constitution), the age of modern science (physics, chemistry, and so on), the age of modern war (WWI, institution banking), the age of social awakening (Roe v. Wade, Nixon visits China, sexual revolution), and finally the age of the celestial big reveal (e.g., Close Encounters of the Third Kind).


Anchoring to a Chinese meaning of a Water Ox that aligns well with Hebrew meaning, I conclude that the Messiah was born 8 BC.  The 60-year cycle could be classified as a big year.  The 33rd big year occurred in 1973; and the 34th big year will occur in 2033. 

1913, 1853, 1793 


Interestingly, the Water Ox is preceded (12 years earlier) by a Metal Ox (辛丑年: [industrious] + [two-knife]) which is possibly the year of Nephi's birth (20 BC) as the great KHERESH.  In addition, the Water Ox is succeeded (12 years later) by a Wood Ox (乙丑年: [second position] + [two-knife]) which is the year of Joseph Smith's birth in 1805.

 

##### Birth dates: the Messiah and Nephi's brother Jacob 
The Book of Mormon prophesy as presented was precise, 600 years.  Certainly the Messianic birth is part of the prophecy.  What is the other anchor exactly?  Was it also a birth?  If so, who was born?  If we accept the Christian narrative at face value, there was a new star in the heavens appearing before the Messianic birth: a star in the east and wonders in the heavens.  The interchange between Herod and the "wise men" may suggest that many, many celestial events were occuring, so it was difficult to ascertain which sign was the prophetic one.

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript and its editorialization.

##### Shazer: Jacob is born at the Mountain of Almonds (aka Sinai)
My current understanding is that the word "Shazer" was the marker of the 600 year prophecy.  It represented the birth of Jacob, Nephi's younger brother.  And at his birth, there were many signs in the heavens.  "Shazer" (rudimentary definition being: Sha [garden] - zer [birth]) is what I would classify as a superword in Nephi's language (which interestingly Joseph Smith described when discussing Egyptian later in his life: one or two symbols could tell an entire story).  The two word stems can tell an entire story, and this was a teaching device: a sacred grove of almond trees, early spring, snow or blossoms dropping like snow or both, a difficult birth in a garden with an umbilical complication, a sharp knife, a fire, and so on.  This was the birth of Jacob!

#### Synchronizing Dates

If we can calculate when the family left Jerusalem, then we would know what year the Messiah was born.  And vice versa.  

For example, the family can easily move within/without the city walls, so this puts a constraint on the potential year - the city could not be under seige.  The city of Jerusalem was destroyed about 586 BC during a second siege of the city; the first seige occurred about 605 BC.

Next, the data of Samuel the Lamanite regarding the Messianic birth offers another boundary condition.  Many signs already had appeared and Samuel clarified that the ultimate sign would occur a few years after the primary sign.  So what was the primary sign?  And, what would the ultimate sign be?

##### Celestial anchor: Lyra Comet 1P as the primary sign 
NASA has data on various heavenly events, and many of those are cyclical which means they can be estimated if not recorded or referenced in wrriten observations.  During the family journey described in 1 Nephi, there was an unusual cluster of solar/lunar eclipses with totalities visible within the Arabian peninsula.  In addition, a famous comet may have appeared during that time frame (Astophysicists use the cyclical nature of the comet and estimates sightings that are not readily available in written documents).

One of the most famous phenomenon we call the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.  I will give it a more time-honored name, the Comet Lyra or Comet 1P from Lyra.  Joseph Smith observed this phenomenon in 1835 and discussed it as an important sign and wonder of the heavens (and Mark Twain even has a unique relationship with this comet).  The comet Lyra has a cycle (shaw-nah, H8138) that is approximately 75 years: more or less depending on whether the comet gets close to a planet when it enters the planetary region of the solar system and is effected by local gravity.  In addition, the mass of the comet would likely be reduced over time as it emits a stream of material which could possibly create a time trend. 

##### Comet and Shazer 
So maybe the 600-year prophecy was anchored to, or computed from,  the appearance of this comet?  "Bright light" is one meaning of "Shazer" representing both a celestial phenomenon in the heavens as well as the celestial miracle on the earth: the birth of a child as a gift of light (e.g., [dar la luz] in Spanish: a crown of flowing light, see H2213 H2215 H2224 H2225 and so on).  Maybe part of "Shazer" was the appearance of this comet and the prophesy recorded by Lehi was something like: this sign in the heaven will appear eight more times in the next six hundred years (75 x 8 = 600); then, a new star will appear; and then, the Messiah will be born.


##### Cultural Implications of Lyra Comet 1P
If so, the people of Nephi would have likely tracked each occurrence of the cyclical appearance of this comet.  Since the cyclical appearance fluctuates, maybe the data varied within 72-78 year window.  Using modern engineering notation, we would say 75 ± 3 years to capture the uncertainty. 

The people of Nephi considered the age of a man to be about 72 years, why was this?  Was it because the founder [ni] lived to this age?  Or was it anchored to the cyclical nature of this comet?  Again, one must read each number judiciously:  maybe Joseph originally voiced 75 which ultimately was recorded as 72.  Any literal reading should be done cautiously given the nature of the translation process (with or without any editorialization).

And the cosmic cycle of the comet would seem to continue to be an important sign of the heavens for the Ancient Americans.  Maybe it was part of the 2100-year "Colon-mbia" prediction.  This presents the possibility that "Colon-mbia" was also a timed prophecy of 2100 years: 600 + 600 + 600 + 300 = 28 cycles of 75 = 35 cycles of 60.  

Cahokia seems to have been established around 1066 (a final gathering of the cousins) and then disbanded after 1441 (well before Colon-mbia in 1492).  Archeologists have confirmed that many other Ancient American groups (e.g., Marajoara)  disappeared from large lowland cities within the timeframe of 75 years before 1492.  Speculations abound if these groups migrated to isolated locations (the safety of remote highlands in significant jungle) or if they merely chose not to continue having children (negative birth rate) or a combination of both.

##### Other Potential Cultural Implications of Lyra Comet 1P

It has been well established in history that Lyra Comet 1P was used as rational for explaining political events and outcomes.  For example, the Battle of Hastings in 1066 followed the comet's appearance which many at the time associated with England's succession crisis.  

Maybe the Hebrew tradition had similar familiarity with this comet before the "Shazer" era.  And if the celestial events of Nephi's life were similar to celestial events occuring when the Messiah was born, additional insights can be considered.  That is, "Shazer" may have been an ultimate event .




#### Six-hundred year prophecy 
To clarify the six-hundred year prophecy, we need to consider the potential relevance of the comet.  According to our understanding of one historical Chinese astronomical record, a comet believed to be Lyra 1P appeared in 12 BC (26 August - 20 October).  This would be an anchor for the Messianic birth, as it is in the neighborhood for an appropriate date.  So, did this same comet also appear in 612 BC?   According to a different Chinese record, a comet appeared in the autumn of 614 BC (Table II, [https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1982JBAA...92..209B]).  Given the limited data, we may reasonably conclude that this comet was also Lyra 1P.

Anchored to our current temporal assumptions of a solar year (365.2422 days per year), the two appearances occurred a little over 600 years apart: maybe 602 years, two and a half months.  Should we conclude that the  prophecy was literally that number, or was the prophecy anchored to the appearance of the cyclical Lyra 1P Comet with its deviations?  What did Joseph original voice?  That is, if Joseph voiced 602 years, would Sidney have edited the number to 600 based on his knowledge of biblical numerology, specifically the story of Noah?  It is worth noting that no one on the editorial staff for the Book of Mormon (or in the inner circle of the early Church) had significant mathematical prowess.


##### Samuel the Lamanite: add 5 years  
Next, consider the data we can derive from story of Samuel the Lamanite.  Celestial events were being observed.  And, if Comet Lyra 1P was part of the prophecy, it would be considered to be an important marker.  Likely, Samuel used the appearance of the comet to remind the people of the entire prophesy.    Maybe Samuel the Lamanite did indeed say 5 years.  If so, did that mean exactly 5 years?  Or within 5 years?  Maybe Samuel said exactly 3 years and 7 months?  Or maybe "15 days after the fourth vernal equinox from now" which cardinally be anchored to a fifth?   If the published does deviate from the actual, cCompounding what Joseph understood was voiced coupled with his team's understanding of ancient time counting and its accompanying mathematics, the question would remain:  what was the exact motivation for such an editorialization? 


##### The ultimate sign of the Messianic birth  
And what precisely was the official sign of the Messianic birth: a night without darkness (that would be visible globally, not just hemispherically)?  The description may suggest the new star was a supernova event (Kepler held this belief) or a two-star-merging anova.  Did Joseph Smith or his editorial staff know of Kepler's estimation and work this detail into the narrative?  Or did Joseph receive an ancient narrative about Samuel the Lamanite, from which, editorialization may occur?


#### Times and Seasons:  Bookends of the Messianic Life 
Intersecting all available data, I currently conclude that the Messianic birth occurred 5 April 8 BC.  Or maybe 6 April based on Joseph Smith's statement.  This aligns with a Chinese celebration of Qingming: bright lights, sweeping the tombs of the ancestors, and a vague master-servant relationship.  The Chinese had a four-pillars calendar based exclusively on the sun, but the modern lunar-solar calendar will suffice to demonstrate that 8 BC is the year of the Water Ox.  And interestingly, this coincides with the year -600 in the Bengali calendar.

Joseph Smith was a Wood Ox 


##### Year of the Water Ox 
The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".

##### Traditional Challenges to a date earlier than 6BC
Many would dismiss such an early birth year based on Herod-death constraints.  One needs to carefully consider how little we know of the actual story as the narratives we have all have gone through significant editorialization for two millenia.  We have a character Herod who was observing many significant celestial signs.  We have wise men that were seeking to interact with the Messianic family.  Yeshua had to be born; at 8 days Yeshua had to be named and circumcised (was this a Lotus birth?); at 40 days Mary would have been able to present herself at the temple.  Given the interchange between Herod and the wise men, Herod orders all male under the age of 2 to be killed in the region.  Mary/Joseph lived in Nazareth, but Yeshua born in Bethlehem.  The family was warned of Herod's wicked heart and fled to Egypt, likely Alexandria.  At some point the wisemen encountered the family, most suggest this occurred before the family left for Egypt.  As one iterates through the implications of the life and death of the Messiah, all of this data may need to be carefully reconsidered.  Are the order of events literal and accurate?  Was Herod, a Hasmonean that was restoring Hebrew convenants within the Abrahamic tradition, a bad guy?  Are you capable of seeing how the narrative could have been manipulated to paint the Jewish leader as the bad guy so the Roman leadership could be identified as good guys, or at least neutral (washing their hands of the Messianic death)?




So if the Messianic birth was 5 April 8 BC, when was the Messianic death?  This birth anchor is earlier than most would allow given traditions of when the death occurred and the Herod-death constraints.  Again, assuming the Christian tradition at face value (there are also obvious motivations for editorialization), the wisemen encountered the young Yeshua in Alexandria, Egypt when the boy was about 4 years old.  The Herod timeline could work.




##### Numerology of the Perfect Life: The Christ Number 33
Most also believe that 33 is the perfect Christ number and that he lived to be exactly 33 years.  Tradition is that the Messiah was born 1 AD and died 34 AD.  Most scholars place the Messiah Death Event in the 30-33 AD range.  Which is precisely the range we find in 3 Nephi.  

My calculations have Yeshua being born 5 April 8 BC and dying 5 May 31 AD, living 37 years, 30 days.  Not a full 40 years, but more than 30 years: fulfilling a Jewish tradition.  And interestingly, Joseph Smith when he was that age was pondering death.  In January 1843, Joseph gave a sermon focusing on an Old Testament reference that we as God's pinnacle of creation will one day feed the grasses of the field.

##### Impasse: In the 33rd and 34th year ...
Anchored to a belief of exactness within the Book of Mormon, I was at an impasse. All I had was a comment by scholar Royal Skousen when he concluded from his lifetime of study that "Oliver was tricky."  This means that, according to Royal, Oliver Cowdery would make edits to the manuscript and Joseph kept having to review the work to make certain this did NOT continue.  But now, given that Sidney or Oliver may have intentionally manipulated a few dates to fit their internal belief systems, I could look for a Messiah Death date independent of the constraint found in 3 Nephi.

So the various data all aligned very nicely with the exception of 3 Nephi.  A review of the limited data we have, curated by Royal Skousen, shows that the scribes had crossed-out and replaced at least one date in 3 Nephi.  Maybe to align with Sidney's belief that the Messiah lived a perfect life of 33 years, born 1 AD and died 34 AD (an anchor James Talmage would use in his framing of Jesus the Christ).  
My anchors for the birth/death of the Messiah are from a seemingly uninvolved third party:  China.  Qingming occurs 15 days after the equinox on April 5th-ish and means the celebration of the bright lights or pure lights where the living sweep the tombs of their ancestors (possibly preparing them for a promised ressurrection), the year 8BC is my proposal as the origin of the holiday is unknown (conflated with other holiday, traditions, and stories).  I associate this to the supernova predicting the birth of the Messiah.  

And the death anchored to the observation of a solar eclipse with totality visible in the Sea of Japan, 5 May 31 AD.

### Personal reflection in the limit 
Being raised in the Mormon tradition, it was very difficult to challenge one's own internal belief system.  For me personally, the mathematics was undeniable.  But what are the consequences?  Again, I think about the consequences also in a maths frame.  What is the finite state of the system?  I experience cognitive dissonance, I realize my internal belief system is flawed.  So what do I do?  I could play the Dehlin card and spend the rest of my life feeding the flames of real feelings of perceived betrayal.  Where does that road lead?  What is the finite state of that choice?  Living an angry, bitter life.  No, thank you.

So a mathematician will extend and abstract the consequences before settling on a finite state machine.  The Mormon Church institution manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  Once you get on that train, the conclusions are obvious:  The Christian institution formalized by Constantine and reformed ever since has manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  The Masoretic tradition of Jewish thought manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Now consider the four domains of life: physical (health), education, religion, government/economics as defined by Luke 2:52.  I have outlined just the religious dimension of institutional manipulation.  And for this treatise, let's stay focused on the religious domain although the implications obviously flow into the other three.

Once you conclude that institutions manage information for Ciceran purposes (grow and self-preserve), layering of belief needs to be deconstructed and redeveloped:  my Mormon traditions, the underlying Judeo-Christian traditions, and the underlying American-British-Roman traditions.  Nephi was wise when he observes how the "traditions of the fathers" can easily blind us.

If you distill these realities, the obvious conclusion is that the Messiah Death Event was very significant.  Why else would the Masoretes manipulate the original Passover tradition and invent the golden calf narrative which was non-existent in the Greek Septuagint?  Why would the polytheistic Roman society have a mother-son adopt such a minor monotheistic religion if there was not reason (data we do not currently have) to motivate such adoption?  Interestingly, the best source document we have to unlock the truth about the Messiah Death Event is the Book of Mormon, with all of its editorial editions and flaws.

#### Anchor of Faith: 3 days of darkness 
The anchor remains:  3 Nephi says there was 3 days of darkness whereas Christian tradition defines only 3 hours of darkness.  Certainly Sidney would have known the 3-hour tradition yet the 3-day innovation was included.  Maybe this was something Sidney edited, Oliver implemented, and Joseph Smith corrected.  Those details would be fascinating.

Regardless, why did the polemics of the Mormon movement NOT anchor to this obvious difference?  Why was faith not exercised in the literal words of 3 Nephi.  3 days of darkness!  What can cause 3 days of darkness throughout the world?  The answer is obvious: multiple volcanic eruptions that filled the skies with ash. 

And for the modern Mormon institution, what I describe as the Brigham Synod (the culture of my upbringing), where is the strong stance on this very obvious distinction?  Why is the difference avoided or apologized away?  Talk about the ultimate "click-bait" for a modern discussion:  Mormon Church doubles down on 3 Nephi description of three-days of darkness calling Western traditions of Roman history pure fiction! 

This was the anchor of faith from which Mormonism could have thrived to fulfill the promise of Isaiah:  that the knowledge of Jehovah would fill the world like the waters fill the sea.  Apologists seem to want to make this data point disappear rather than anchor and pivot from it.  If Roman tradition says there was 3 hours of darkness and Nephi tradition says there was 3 days of darkness, who should you believe?  An uninvolved witness half way around the world, or a society directly involved with the Messiah Death Event?

Aha!  Can you see?

###### Implications for Romans crafting history
This unlocks the obvious conclusion that the Romans intentionally lied about the details of the Messiah Death Event, which, in turn, will challenge any detail in Roman history after Julius Caesar:  when did the Pompeii destruction occur?  when and how did Tiberius and Caligula die?

The Messiah Death Event was much worse than you can imagine.  More brutal for those tortured AND the Apocalyptic Celestial Response *was* Epic.  There are plenty of clues remaining to this reality, a trinity of triangulating testimonies:  Psalms (20-24), Isaiah (20-24), and Matthew (20-24).  Rome does not recover to take the city of Jerusalem until 70 AD (soldiers die, power structures are destabilized), Roman "historians" begin recrafting a narrative in 100 AD:  Josephus to develop messaging for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger to develop messaging for a Roman audience.


##### The Messiah Death Event
The death likely occurred on 5 May 31 AD.  There was a solar eclipse over the Japan Sea on that day; the Emperor of China observed the occurence, proclaimed a "Son of the heavens has died" and entered his palace [in mourning] for 5 days.  There was an airburst event over Jerusalem that turned stones on the temple's altar to chalkstone.  This event likely created shockwaves that archaelogists associate with a magnitude 6+ earthquake with an epicenter in the middle of the Dead Sea.  The water level of the Dead Sea immediately dropped 50 feet.  Lilies of the field were decimated according to pollen data replaced by flora that can survive in a more arid environment.  Hearty oliveyards and vineyards suffer and rebound.  Trees that trigger seeding after fire-events (pines and pistachios) flourish.  And so on.  


If the Book of Mormon is literally true, why has the Mormon Church never double-downed on the distinction of 3 days NOT 3 hours? Now, as I reflect on my journey, I have concluded that during the Joseph Smith era, everyone understood that Joseph as Prophet received novel content that was organized into the Book of Mormon with the help of his scribes.  If true, such an objective anchor would NOT be so objective for those living in that era.  

But what of the modern movement?  Does it also have knowledge that such a distinction (3 days, not 3 hours) may have been an editorialization?  

Regardless, stepping forward with faith that the 3 days of darknesses was not edited by Oliver or Sidney, the implications are tremendous.  

And that, my dear reader, is the seed needed to move forward.  To reconstruct your understanding of the Messiah Death Event.  To unlock how instutitions manipulate you to thrive and grow:  in healthcare, in education, in religion, in government/economics/politics.  To enable you to understand the purpose of this planet [mor-mon-ya] and your celestial heritage.

Godspeed.  Namaste.
