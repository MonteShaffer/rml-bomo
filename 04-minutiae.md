## Behind the mathematician's curtain 
Many times a mathematician working on a proof does NOT reveal the minutiae that led to the distilled essence and result.  So, it can be difficult to understand "how" one arrived at that conclusion which led to a search for a mathematical proof.  For me, an independent study of the times and seasons associated with the birth and death of the Messiah in association to the numbers provided in the Book of Mormon was the key data that has put me on a path of rediscovery:  challenging my internal belief systems.  At the time, this dilemna led me to consider if Oliver was tricky:  could Oliver have intentionally changed numbers to fit his belief system that would disrupt my calculations?  

### Six-hundred year anchor
For me, the anchor point is the number 600. 

As I disclose my process, please understand that it was non-linear, recursive, and iterative.  My effort to describe it requires taking the complex process of learning and placing the result into a linear frame.

The six hundred year prophecy is anchored to the birth of the Messiah.  And an event associated with Nephi's family when leaving the area of Jerusalem for the deserts of Arabia.

The number 600 in mathematics has embedded within the first perfect number, 6.  Some key ways of arriving at 600 are:  60 × 10; 75 x 8; 50 x 12; 100 x 6.  The story of Noah references the number 600.  Preliminary calculations anchored to year 0 (mathematician's dating system) for the Messianic birth:  Nephi's family around 600 BC, maybe Muhammad around 600 AD (hijra was 622 AD).  Other Abrahamic markers may include:  Abraham, Joseph in Egypt, and/or Moses.  Maybe the great Buddha was born at some point within this special cycle (e.g., 1800 BC), not limiting the pattern to only Abrahamic tradition.

#### Sixty-year Chinese Cycle 
The Chinese have a 60 year cycle (干支) that may be considered a "big year" based on the 12 earthly branches (地支 dìzhī) commonly identified by animals: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.  And 5 earth elements (五行 wuxing): Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood matched to the duality of the yin-yang to form 10 celestial stems. (Technically, the 60-year cycle would be a 120-year cycle if the light/shadow element of yin-yang were carefully considered.) 

Every 60 years, 5 earth stems pass through 12 heaven stems where the heaven stems are today associated with an animal and an etiological story of a race describes the order of the 12 animals.  The first animal is the Rat, followed by the Ox.  The Ox gave the Rat a ride for a large portion of the race and either the Rat deceived the Ox to win OR the Ox allowed the Rat to win ('you go a head'). 

The symbol for the number 10 in Chinese is the same symbol as the original [tav] of Ancient Hebrew, the symbol of the cross.  The Roman Numeral was merely a rotation of [+] to form an [X].  Six hundred years would be 10 big years; that is 10 cycles of sixty years.

#### Hebrew truth 
In Hebrew, the word for truth/justice/stability consists of three Hebrew letters [amt] (אֱמֶת) where aleph represents a cow, mem represents water (and the chaos of a low-point), and tav represents the cross.  Altogether this may represent the Messianic purpose.

The Messiah may represent a Water Ox that bears a cross, connecting the chronology of the Chinese with the belief that the Messiah would show a way back to the celestial (see John 14:6).  Following traditional Christian anchors, the Messiah was Yeshua.  Yeshua had a cousin, commonly called the Baptist, that would be the precursor for Yeshua:  possibly named Yaḥyā.

#### Water Ox preceded by Water Rat 
The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".  This may represent the Messiah.

The year before the Water Ox is the year of the Water Rat (壬子年]):  [scholar] + [child/progeny] (seed/egg) + [bend-one-ten] (year).   An obvious interpretation could be the "year where a scholar is a seed for one to follow".  That is, the one to precede the Messiah, a cousin that would be a scholar linking the wisdom of the celestial with the learning of men on earth.

Around the year 0, the closest possible year of the Water Ox is 8 BC.  An anchor for the birth of the Messiah.  

### Two celestial signs: a primary and an ultimate 
What are the significant celestial signs that were anchors for the prophecy of the Messianic birth?

#### Herod and the wise men 
In the New Testament, we have a narrative that : (1) a new star appeared in the east leading foreign wise men to the region who were following this star in order to meet the Messianic child; (2) in their local search, these wise men seek an audience with Herod; (3) Herod is curious about the timing of the "new star" as several celestial events had been observed; (4) after learning the "when", Herod reportedly orders that every male born (in the region under the age of two) to be killed; (5) the wise men encounter the child with Mary/Joseph and offer gifts, the family flees into Egypt, and assumingly, the wise men depart the region returning home.  

We can infer Jewish tradition in the birth story.  First, the child would need to be born and, if immediately swaddled and placed in a manager, a lotus-birth would need to be eliminated as a possibility.  Second, the child would be presented to the local synagogue at 8 days old and given a name.  Third, if the child is a male, the naming would be accompanied with a circumcision of the child.  Fourth, a waiting period (likely to see if the child would live), defined as a purification period, would be observed:  8 x 5 = 40 days for a male and 8 x 10 = 80 days for a female.  Thereafter, the child would be presented to God in the temple with sacrificial rituals.  In this case, a firstborn male was (by definition) intended to serve God according to traditions of the House of Jacob.  However, since the decision to empower the tribe of Levi with priestly duties, other tribes could offer a proxy sacrifice known as "redemption of the first born" to absolve the first-born service requirement.  In context of this being a Messianic birth, did such an absolution occur? 
 
Other questions remain:  How old was the Messiah when the wise men finally found the family?  What exactly was the order and timing of significant traditional events: wise men offer gifts, family flees to Egypt, Herod dies, family returns from Egypt, Messiah at bar mitzvah (age 12) amazes the erudites in the temple, and so on.  How many wise men were there?  Were there also wise women?  Did they give gifts and leave, or did they stay and observe the Messianic life?  Were they tutors for the young child?  Were the wise men locals (from the Abrahamic tradition) or globals (from all regions of the world)?

Just to answer the question of timing (when the Messiah was born), the primary clue from the Herodian story is that significant celestial events were being observed and Herod understood that a sign of the prophesized Messianic birth occurred about two years previously.  So which sign was that?

#### Samuel the Lamanite
Samuel the Lamanite appears to the Ancient Americans after significant celestial events were being observed.  Seemingly, these observations, like in the Levant, created speculation as to their specific meaning.  Before clarifying the meaning of the celestial events, Samuel rebukes the society for the ever-so-common sin of "grinding the face of the poor" (see Isaiah 1).  Samuel then reminds the people of the details of the six-hundred year prophecy.  The initial observation, which I will label the primary marker, had occurred.  However, a more significant sign, a unique and ultimate marker was yet to occur.  That is, the ultimate sign would follow the primary sign by a few years (recorded in the editorialized Book of Mormon as: precisely 5 years from now, which is shortly after the primary sign, an ultimate sign would be given).

Interestingly, about 40 years later, when the Messiah visits America after the resurrection, the scribes are (gently) rebuked for excluding these significant prophecies of Samuel.  Seemingly, the pure-blood guardians of the records made an editorial decision to exclude the words of the brown-skinned outsider.

####  Supernova as ultimate sign 
The ultimate sign was that the sun would set yet the sky for one night would not darken.  That implies that the sign would generate enough light to brighten the sky.  And if this was a global phenomenon (not hemispheric), the bright lights would endure for at least 24 hours. 

In modern vernacular, we may call this event a supernova event described as a powerful and luminous explosion of a star.  The apparent magnitude (or brightness) of a star is a function of its distance from Earth and the intensity of light that the star emits.  This new star was likely previously present in the night sky but was not bright enough to be seen.  If the star exploded, the blast would immediately emit tremendous amounts of light, which would diminish over time as, according to modern theory, the star dies:  a explosion with significant light in the heavens, the source of light is seen as a "new star", the new star continually diminishes in brightness until the star fades from view.    

Johannes Kepler had the opportunity to experience two supernova events in his lifetime.  The first occurred in 1572 when Kepler was an infant, yet later in life he was able to oversee the reprints of Tycho's descriptions to appreciate this event.  The second occurred on 17 October 1604.  This "new star" was the brightest star in the heavens and was visible during the day for twenty or more days and visible at night for over a year. At the time, Kepler believed a supernova event like the two he experienced during his lifetime was the explanation for the Star of Bethlehem in Christian tradition. 

Supernova are rare events.  Often, they are surrounded with controversy.  Some cultures believe supernovae are categorically bad omens; other cultures believe the exact opposite: a supernova as light can only bring good.  Even others cultures consider the celestial rarity to be a message that leads to speculation, discussion, and action.  For example, Queen Elizabeth asked astronomical mathematicians for advice after observing the 1572 supernova.  Or consider the story of Galileo.  Many believe that Galileo used the 1604 event as an impetus to challenge the orthodoxy of Aristotelian physics romanticized with the phrase "E pur si muove".

####  5 April 8 BC: Qingming celebration  
Anchoring to a fixed equinox as March 21, I propose that exactly half a month later (15 days later) would be the timing for the Messianic birth.  That is, 5 April 8 BC.  

Singificant markers for this conclusion include:  Nowruz anchored to human observation not mathematical cycles; Isaiah's reprimand of the house of Jacob using lunations for its calculations; replacing the lunar anchor with a solar anchor (equinox); the basic concept of the Passover occuring mid-month after a celestial marker; a year being defined as exactly 360 days containing 12 months of 30 days BEFORE some celestial event which caused some groups to celebrate these extra days given (epagomenal days that are outside of times/seasons) giving us the modern 365.2422-day year.

Astronomical documentation for a supernova occuring on this date at the moment is unavailable.  The Chinese do have a festival (celebratory holiday) aligning with this date.  The Qingming festival (清明节:  green/blue water + sun/moon brightness + celebration) is defined to be 15 days following the equinox, varying from between 4 April to 6 April.  The festival is associated with bright lights.  On this day, the living visit burial sites of the ancestors and sweep the tombs (as if preparing the ancestors for resurrection).  In addition, this holiday has a reference to a strange master-servant story that demonstrates loyalty and love amidst a trial of shared suffering.

This festival is anchored to a solar marker, not a lunar marker.  Agrarian centers of ancient China would develop calendars anchored to the sun, including: 大明历 (oldest + brightest + calendar), 四分曆  (son enclosure + divide in 10 + experience/history/event), 四時八節曆 (son enclosure + time/season + divide/eight + segment/classify + experience/history/event).  The year would begin on the equinox consisting of months of 30 days.  A month would be segmented into thirds, known as decans.  That is, a 10-day week.  A week would consist of two pentads, or 5-day periods.  Every few years, an extra decan (10-days) would be added to the year (midsummer) to correct for epagomenal differences between the ideal (360 days) and the observed (365.25-ish days) suggesting that the calendar equinox would drift a few days from the actual equinox.  Of note, is the anchor of time to the number ten, specifically, two sets of 5.  Easy to count using your hands.  And anchored to social interactions.  For example, a agrarian worker was told to bathe at least once every 5 days.  Or, an emperor would retreat into his palace and mourn for 5 days.

#### Lyra Comet 1P as primary sign 
The "ultimate" sign, a supernova, was unique and novel.  And it would occur, according to Samuel the Lamanite after a repeating celestial event.  This primary sign was likely a comet.  A comet, from earth appears to be a star that is moving with a tail, that changes direction, and then disappears.  And then, after some time, the cycle repeats again:  appears, changes direction, and disappears.  Even within one culture, there have been many names for these "guest stars".

| Chinese  | Meaning | Roots |
| :--:| :------: | :---- |
| 孛星 |   bushy star    | ten + cover + child : sun/day + life |
| 彗星 |   broom star   | abundance + abundance + "pig-snout" : sun/day + life |
| 掃星 |  sweeping star   | hand + "pig-snout" + cover + turban/scarf : sun/day + life |
| 天攙 |  heavenly intermingler   | one + big : knife + mouth + compare/compete + knife + mouth + second + line + dot |
| 篷星 |  sailing star   | bamboo + go + walk + one + two + line : sun/day + life  |
| 長星 |  long star   |  long/grow OR chief/elder OR "pig-snout" + one + bend : sun/day + life  |
| 燭星 |  candle-flame star   |  fire + net + wrap + insect : sun/day + life  |

The most well-known of these moving celestial bodies is vulgarly called the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.  A more culturally-nuetral label, Lyra Comet 1P will be used to describe this recurring phenomenon.

Lyra Comet 1P has a cyclical orbit, appearing approximately every 75 years: more or less depending on whether the comet gets close to a planet when it enters the planetary region of the solar system and is effected by local gravity.  In addition, the mass of the comet would likely be reduced over time as it emits a stream of material which could possibly create a directional time-trend. 

#### Comets as candidates for the Star of Bethlehem

Chinese records suggest there may be several candidates for consideration if one believes the Star of Bethlehem was a comet:  16 BC, 12 BC, 10 BC, 5 BC, 4 BC.  Most dismiss the 16 BC and 10 BC candidates as replicates or not fully developed descriptions.  With a traditional anchor that Herod died in 4 BC, many conclude that the Messianic birth occurred in April of 5 BC.  But what about the two-year boundary condition with the wise men?  And was Herod on his death bed when meeting with the wise men.  Taking all of these details in their entirety, 12 BC is a reasonable anchor for the primary sign, followed by a supernova some time later.

If we take Samuel's words as "5 years exactly", a supernova occuring on 5 April 8 BC would necessitate a lesser-yet-primary sign to occur on 5 April 13 BC.  The Chinese record details the comet being visible on 26 August 12 BC, visible for over 56 days.  The exactness of the 5 years from Samuel is off by at most 222 days.  However, we do not know the details of Samuel the Lamanite prophecy; or rather, a reminder of an more ancient prophecy.  Did the people of Nephi use a solar calendar with an equinox start date?  If the first landing was in South America, would they establish time based on the September equinox?  Or was there a times/seasons recipe for measuring time preserved within the brass plates, originally defined by Abraham or his great-grandson Joseph?  

The six-hundred year prophecy and its relationship to the story of Nephi and his family in Jerusalem will give us some additional insights.

#### Leaving Jerusalem six hundred years earlier
The Messianic prophecy had many celestial markers within the window of the birth date.  We conclude the preliminary marker is a primary, recurring appearance of a comet, approximately 12 BC.  Next, the ultimate marker of the precise birth to occur on 5 April 8 BC.

So, should we also expect two events six-hundred years prior?  First, let's consider the recurring marker of a comet.  Did Comet Lyra 1P appear in 612 BC?  The Chinese did observe a comet at this time; according to Wikipedia, in the year 613 BC; according to a Harvard Research article  (Table II, [https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1982JBAA...92..209B]), a comet appeared in the autumn of 614 BC. 

##### Josiah's life mission and death 
According to biblical chronology, Josiah the King of Jerusalem died in August 609 BC.  About 5 years after the comet appeared.  Was the appearance of Comet Lyra 1P an impetus for Josiah to renovate the temple which led to the discover of lost prophecies and ultimately his death?  Creating a speculative time for everyone living in Jerusalem at the time, witnessing these events?  Maybe young Nephi was only 8 years old when he witnessed this celestial event.  

In the renovation of the temple, lost prophecies were found and carefully studied.  Upon reading them, Josiah rips his garments and goes into mourning.  Thereafter, he seeks counsel from the MISNE.  Huldah, the keeper of the wardrobe, and likely the chief prophetess, gives him guidances.  Seemingly, the prophecy had some references to the feminine worship in the temple, many conclude some reference to the cakes baked for the Queen Mother of Heaven and the Asherah poles/trees that adorned the temple grounds.  The King follows her counsel: the cessation of worship the Queen Mother in the temple (which Jeremiah later second-guesses after Jerusalem falls), tearing down Asherah poles at the temples (the primary in Jerusalem and others throughout the region) and killing some of the priest class, the KOHEN, burning their bones to ash on the altars of these temples.  Very strange narrative, which gets stranger.  

The details of the prophecies that motivates these actions has been lost to time; the Deutoronomists and Masoretes (likely members of the priest class) were themselves motivated to editorialize some details of the story.  As a result, the narrative that leads to Josiah's death gets even more bazaar.  Why exactly would the Deutoronomists/Masoretes keep the primary narrative yet NOT include the actual prophecies Josiah/Huldah read and interpreted?   Were they from Zenos and Zenock?  Were they intentionally excluded as they (1) made the KOHEN look bad, (2) referenced accurate information about the Messiah Death Event, (3) linked the KOHEN class to the Messiah Death Event?

It is also worth noting that the KOHEN class and the MISNE class are likely independent groups.  Likely, the MISNE had men/women representing the 12 tribes of the house of Jacob.  The women would take care of defining the Torah in relation to the feminine as well as the temple-related activities for females.  Huldah likely gave advice to Josiah about the feminine aspects of the prophecy; the men of the MISNE would have likely given counsel regarding the killing of KOHEN.  Such a decision (kill a group of KOHEN, burn there bodies to ash on the altars of temples) would not make Josiah or the MISNE popular among the KOHEN class.

##### Josiah retrieves the Ark of the Covenant 
The KOHEN were guardians of the Ark of the Covenant.  King David used this artifact as a weapon of war.  During this time, the KOHEN was very active.  King Solomon retired the weapon placing it within a room within a room: the holy of holies.  Now, once a year, the KOHEN would send one person in this room to perform ritual ceremonies.  Over time, since there was little to do, the KOHEN developed a proxy-service for the BBQ on the temple grounds.  That is, anyone could bring their own animal, pray over it, and cook it.  Yet, since the KOHEN were assigned as guardians of the Ark, they were always around on temple grounds, and found a way to streamline the BBQ process, keep themselves relevant, and as we learn from the story of Eli/Yeshua, "rob the poor" as they transformed the family atmosphere into a "den of thieves".   

One group of KOHEN who had built a temple in Elephantine (Egypt) seemingly wanted to return to the days of Old, to the active war-mongering days of David.  They transferred the Ark of the Covenant out of Jerusalem, and advised Necho to take God's instrument to war.  Likely, splinter-KOHEN group was marching with Necho carrying the artifact for the Egyptian leader.  Now, Josiah, marching to intercept this army would make sense.  Necho responds "What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you".  Seemingly, a group of KOHEN convinced Necho that they could speak for God (or enable Necho to do so).  Yet Josiah persists.  

If Josiah was retrieving the Ark of the Covenant, the narrative makes more sense.  "Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you" may be a latent marker for a group of KOHEN carrying the Ark of the Covenant to war for Necho.  The narrative was obfuscated to conceal the KOHEN's potential wrong doing.  Josiah is shot by arrows from Necho's archers and returns to Jerusalem where he dies.  And latently, it would seem, he died successfully retrieving the Ark of the Covenant.  Josiah died in August 609 BC.  

##### The family of Nephi, the Ark of the Covenant, and the Brass Plates 
The political turmoil of Jerusalem would be unprecedented: Josiah just died and his succession may be in dispute as Josiah has sons from two wives with diplomatic relationships to competing neighbors from the North and South.  And, it would seem, Nephi's family left the city within a few months following Josiah's death.  And, if you read the narratives carefully, the family took the Ark of the Covenant with them to America where Nephi built a temple to house it.  When the city was sieged in 605 BC and 586 BC, the Ark was not found.  Later prophets voiced that the Ark left the region, never to return.  

And now, some of the narrative of Nephi makes more sense.  Why would Laman, the firstborn, approach the keeper of the treasury, Laban, and just ask for the brass plates?  Nothing is offered in exchange, so it would seem, the family had legal property rights to the records.  Seemingly, when the family packed up their tents (and tabernacle), it was assumed that the brass plates were housed within the Ark of the Covenant.  The Ark contained several significant artifacts (likely including what was described by Nephi as a Liahona: lehi-hona as 'river islands' and 'path/journey'; a guidance system).  The written record (brass plates) is not found among the artifacts, so the brothers are sent to retrieve them.

Isaiah predicted that the archers/arrows of Kedar would protect a group fleeing south after "binding the tabernacle (tᵊʿûḏâ)", (Isa 8:16).  That this group would be burdened with personal riches on the shoulders of young asses and the wealth of the treasury on humps of camels, carrying the treasures to a land where it will have no value; where the people will consider such things shameful (Isa 30:6).  Well, it would seem that Nephi recovered the family wealth, plus so much more.  A careful reading poses some additional questions:  Who exactly was the young and old lion ('law-bee' and 'lah-yish' as a wordplay of Lehi or was this lost in translation meaning 'ari' in Egyptian not Hebrew:  the young and old artisan)?  And who exactly was the viper and the fiery flying serpent?

##### "Shazer" on 5 April 608 BC: Jacob is born at the Mountain of Almonds (aka Sinai)
The family of Nephi was safely established in tents near a fresh-water well close to the Red Sea (near a modern-day border of Israel, Jordan, and Saudia Arabia).  


![Well 23](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/Well-23.png?raw=true) *Well 23:* Just north of a wadi, well 23 is an ancient well that may have been near where the family setup camp before leaving for "Shazer".

They had recovered all the artifacts necessary to continue their journey.  They had convinced another family to join them as well.  One of the women was pregnant, soon to give birth to Nephi's brother, Jacob.  Yet, to fulfill prophecy, the family must move a short distance before "Shazer" so the Liahona is the impetus to force the men to break-down camp and the women to raise their skirts to cross the nearby high-water river (Isa 47:2), travel four days SSE and camp at the base of the Mountain of Almonds (Jabal al-Lawz).

Joseph Smith, as he was studying the Egyptian papyri in 1835 (the year Lyra Comet 1P appeared in his lifetime), had a scribe decipher some of the Egyptians glyphs on one side of a page, from which an entire narrative would be composed.  Joseph would proclaim that a few glyphs could tell an entire story.  Many scoff at such a claim, but it would seem this was an Egyptian literary (and possibly pedagogical) instrument.  

"Shazer" (rudimentary definition being: Sha [garden] - zer [birth]) is what I would classify as a superword in Nephi's language.   The two syllables can tell an entire story: to make haste to a sacred grove of almond trees with a spring of fresh water flowing from a ravine, snow or blossoms dropping like snow or both (early spring), a difficult birth (possibly a lost twin) in a garden with an umbilical complication, bright lights in the heavens, a sharp knife, a fire, a washing, an anointing, a crown of flowing light, and so on.  This was the birth of Jacob!

If Jewish traditions were followed, the sojourners would remain at least 40 days at this location before continuing the journey.  

##### Shazer as 'dar la luz'
"Bright light" is one significant element in the "Shazer" narrative.  There was a celestial phenomenon in the heavens.  And the birth of Jacob was a celestial miracle on earth.  That is, the birth of a child represents a gift of light and the birthing process can be described as "to give the light" (e.g., Spanish phrase [dar la luz]).

###### Egyptian "sha"

The primary meaning of "sha" in Egyptian is garden, symbolized with a row of trees in the hieroglyph.  A deeper dive into the "sh" worldlist is quite interesting.

![water in the garden](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Garden.png?raw=true) *water in the garden*

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript and its editorialization.

###### Nephi narratives as "sha" wordplay

Now, the wordplay to craft stories is beginning to emerge.  It would seem like the introduction is anchored to the power of the [sh] which is fundamentally the power of woman.  Very interesting indeed.  So are there other [sh] sounds we can piece together to recreate the 1 Nephi narrative?

![Nephi synopsis](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Nephi-synopsis.png?raw=true) *Nephi synopsis*: Nephi synopsis of introduction: Our family traveled into the desert, a parent proposed we (the brothers) return to Jerusalem to acquire the writings.  I will go and do.  I observed the sword was of curious craftsmanship.  … Later, the family of Ishmael joined us and my "Ishtar" (?Moron ?Alma) became my consummated wife.

![Nephi kills Laban](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Nephi-night.png?raw=true) *Nephi kills Laban*: I will go and do, sneak around the city at night and skillfully kill Laban.  And since "sh" can also represent a wall, maybe include that element to the story: climbing a wall of a city at night seems to be a common strategy among the brave in the stories that follow.


![Lehi's vision](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Lehi.png?raw=true) *Lehi's vision*: A gulf of misery, joy for some, lamentation for others


![Nephi steering boat](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Nephi-boat.png?raw=true) *Nephi steering boat*: I was steering the boat, my brothers designed to mutiny, a tempest arose driving us backward, I was again free, I again was steering the boat to an unknown foreign land 


###### Other Biblical narratives using "sha" wordplay

To ascertain if this wordplay is a common literary device of the ancients, let's consider two additional examples:  one from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament.  As you begin to see the power of the wordplay, you will observe that some words used in one example could have also been used in another example which would give the story an even richer meaning.

![Josiah renovates the temple](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Josiah.png?raw=true) *Josiah renovates the temple*:  Josiah commissions quarry work to renovate the temple, documents and writings are discovered.  Josiah examines these, tears his garments, returns to his palace (office) and is full of grief and sorrow.

![Yeshua considers the Lilies of the Field](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/sh-Yeshua.png?raw=true) *Yeshua considers the Lilies of the Field*:  To "consider" means to ponder, reflect, engage in the "sapien" dimension of humanity that makes us homo sapiens.  Lilies do NOT engage in such activity, yet have a beauty unsurpassed.

For the uninitiated, the word "sha" can mean garden or field; Solomon's name is tied to the concept of peace "shaw-lawm".  This should be sufficient to enable a literary hunt for a potential alliteration in this remnant of a teaching from Yeshua.  Or possibly some other poetic form.  Interestingly, as a young boy Yeshua lived in Egypt.  Possibly in Alexandria, the home of the largest library in the region.  Was he trained in the classic Egyptian and Early Paleo-Hebrew language?  A decomposition of this famous saying seems to strongly indicate so.  Emphatically. 

###### Implications 
There are a few significant implications to this literary wordplay.  First, understanding that they exist enables one to attempt to recraft known stories back into the ancient Egyptian.  Possibly.  This is a rule that can be utilized to start assembling the puzzle.  It is analagous to a corner piece or straight-edge piece.  

Second, maybe [sh] is the first letter of the alphabet.  

Third, does Nephi outline an entire abecedarian on the small plates?  

Fourth, did Mormon implement the literary form AFTER discovering the small plates?  Mormon does attempt to use a phonetic anchor [kh] in one portion of his writings.  This is why the Korihor story seems so disjoint from the main storyline.  And within the [kh] storyline, there are some very odd interjections.  Was Mormon trying his hand at the ancient literary practice?  It would seem that Mormon was not very good at this, so maybe it was new to him.  Or maybe, after he had written his curated summary, he discovered Nephi's literature and was both amazed and humbled.

Finally, the correlation of the broken Hebrew with the broken Egyptian in context of a literary wordplay will enable an iterative process that will inform and update each of the three elements.

Seemingly, the "zer" stem represents the entire conception process: the mixing of fluids (like adding wet yeast to a dough) to grow a child which breaks forth and is born.  That is, the sowing, the growing, and the breaking forth.  Therefore, as we may say "this person was born to be a consecrated priest", the ancients may say "this person was sown to become a consecrated priest."  If anything, the planting of the seed (consummation leading to conception), is most important in the ancient language: to spring forth or to raise up.  

That is, where Nephi's brother Jacob was breaking forth, Nephi's first-born son may have been planted into a well.  Is it Mor-on-i or Cum-or-yah?  In context of this location, likely Cum-or-yah  (the rising light of Jehovah) was conceived at Shazer.  Mor-on-i (captain of navy) would be more intuitive when the family settles in Southern Arabia and eventually Nephi builds one or more maritime vessels.


###### Egyptian "zer"
Does Egyptian have a "z" sound?  Yes, it seems that early Egyptologists used the "s" to represent two distinct characters:  the "lamad" symbol was one form of "s" and the "two-horizontal knots" was another form of "s" (called a "door bolt" by some) which today has been mapped to the "z" sound.  The same sound in Hebrew is mapped to a symbol that looks like an equal sign and may represent "sweat" as in, the sweat of the brow.  Interestingly, the Egyptian use of "z" seems to activate something inactive, representing the action of "making it so".  That is the "z" symbol prepends to the known: for example, "baq" meaning shiny becomes "z'baq" meaning to make shiny or to cause to be shiny.  That is, by the sweat of the brow, a human acts to make a thing/state.

Interestingly, it has been concluded that the Egyptian language did not have the "l" sound (like lion) which is strange considering the ability to pronounce such a sound is not difficult.  And the "lamad" symbol exists in early Hebrew which produces such a sound.  Was it a cultural omission to focus on Ra by intentionally removing the L from the language system?

At some point in the translation processes, maybe late in history by the Masoretes or maybe after the exile, confusion from lost knowledge seemed to abound.  Consider, for example, the word "to dress with clothes" in Hebrew: [law-bash'] (H3847).  Compare it to the Egyptian words:  [sab-ash] (to get dressed - with help).  The symbol for the lamad "l" in Hebrew is the same as one of the "s" symbols in Egyptian.  The "hook" in Hebrew may be on the left side and the Egyptian may have the "hook" to the right side, and a little longer, possibly representing the idea of folding a piece of clothing on a chair.   Regardless, it would seem, in the passage of time, the clarity was lost, and sab-ash became law-bash.  Other more advanced deviations seem to be [aw-saw'] (H6213) and [kaw-saw'] (H3640). 

Additionally, the difference of the two "s" symbols in Egyptian may have been age or gender specific.  What looks like a "lamad" may represented folded cloth, so the young (female) "s" may be a simple full-body tunic (thawb/hijab) that they would have worn to cover their bodies whereas the adult (male) "s" may have been a simple clothe/belt around the loins.

![Give birth in a garden](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-Birth.png?raw=true) *Give birth in a garden*:  To make shine and to make pregnant seemed to be very similar in sound.  The pregnancy appears to conclude with a woman squatting (in a garden) allowing the child to break forth.  The "za" and "za't" represent the male and female child respectively.  The "z" symbol seems to represent the union (copulation) that leads to a child.  Or, the penetration of a seed into the earth for a plant.  The seed of man penetrates the well of the woman, and if the woman shows signs after opening her legs and embracing a man, an offspring will (after a time) gush forth.  See Alma 32. 

![Time](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-Time.png?raw=true) *Time*:  Time leads to the birth of a free man, who may engage in war with another free man, may show graciousness in life as a noble man.

![Fire and Water](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-FireWater.png?raw=true) *Fire And Water*:  The fire or flame leads to marital congress, a moment of bliss when the seed is planted.  The gushing forth of water is the process which causes a woman to tremble and shake.


![Yeast and Rejuvenation](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-Misc.png?raw=true) *Yeast and Rejuvenation*:  Yeast is an active ingredient that helps bread rise as a "proper planting" of a man's seed in the woman's well would cause the woman's womb to grow.  Likely, the cakes prepared for the Queen Mother of Heaven in the ancient temple were directly associated with the desires of a betrothed woman to become a mother, an Ishtar [H802].  

![Milk](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/z-Misc2.png?raw=true) *Milk*:  




### Shazer and the six-hundred year prophecy
About 5 April 608 BC, Jacob is born at the event Nephi describes as "Shazer", meaning the twisting.  The month of April is known for the Lyrid meteor showers.  Chinese "star gazers" first recorded observing these meteor showers from Lyra in ~686 BC.  They first observed a meteorite hitting the earth in ~643 BC.  So what exactly was seen in the heavens, in the stars, when Jacob was born?

Lyra Comet 1P already appeared in the heavens about five years earlier.  Was there a supernova event at this time?  Did a meteorite strike the top of the Mountain creating a fire, a new "Sinai" event?  Was there a volacanic eruption?
  
We do not know exactly.  We do know that the 1 Nephi narrative never mentions stars which is indeed strange given the context of their travels in Arabia.  Maybe "Shazer" represents a cartouche-of-sorts clarifying that the heavens were filled with signs and wonders.  Regardless, Lyra Comet 1P was a warning to Jerusalem that begin the chaos that led to the family being isolated in the desert at the [Mount of Almonds](https://thepilgrim.co/jabal-al-lawz/) for Jacob to be born at this sacred place.  The mountain of all mountains.  A place where Abraham (and Moses) and Joshua already communed with the heavens.  A place where Yeshua and Muhammad would later commune with the heavens.  A sacred cross roads for Abraham located in the land of his six youngest sons:  the Midians.

Samuel the Lamanite clarified that the Messianic birth would be celestially announced by a supernova five years after seeing the cyclical appearance of Lyra Comet 1P.  Does that mean the six-hundred year prophecy had a similar, two-stage anchor of reference?  The pattern seems to be:  Lyra Comet 1P creates speculation and wonder by observers (of all ages) and then something happens thereafter.  

Consider the comet's appearance in April 1066.  Speculation abounded by locals that there was a succession crisis in Britain.  William of Normandy leveraged this phenomenon to invade Britain in October and thereafter the Normans controlled much of Britain until 1154 when Henry II became an undisputed British monarch.


#### Cycles of 60 and 75
A 60-year cycle, the cycle of the return of the Water Ox can be anchored to the year 8 BC.  A 75-year cycle, the cycle of the return of Lyra Comet 1P can be anchored to the year 12 BC.  From those anchors, we can review the past and future, to ascertain any significant historical change points.  Of note is the fact that these cycles will coincide (plus or minus a few years) every 300 years:  60 × 5 = 75 × 4.

The 60-year cycle is purely mathematical so will not have any deviations.   Anchoring to a solar equinox as a New Year (Nowruz), the passage of time is easy to measure.  However, the appearance of some initial signs in the heavens that led to speculation (that then enabled Samuel the Lamanite to enter the frame and begin preaching), indicates a cycle with uncertainty.  That is, the 75-year cycle of Lyra Comet 1P.

The people of Nephi considered the age of a man to be about 72 years, why was this?  Was it because the founder [ni] lived to this age?  Or was it anchored to the cyclical nature of this comet?  Or maybe both?

](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/Lyra-trend.png?raw=true) *Lyra Comet 1P: 75-year cycle with deviations*

The trend of the comet is rather consistent after the appearance immediately preceding the Messianic birth.  There appears to be a sinusoidal deviation around a simple linear trend:  On average, every 75 years, the comet appears 2.1 years later.  In 20 cycles (1500 years later), the deviation would be 42 years according to the estimated trend and actual observation.  This trend does not help astrological speculation before the Messianic birth.  However, given its importance at the onset of the story for the family of Nephi, it would be carefully monitored and documented.  

### Colon-mbia: the 2100-year prophecy
The 2100-year prophecy was very likely part of the legend of Nephi found on the small plates.  If you can recognize the 1830s puffery about Columbus coupled with the anti-semitic sentiment, the elements of editorialization can be appropriately filtered.

- Colon (or Colom) was the name prophesied.  In a historical document, this is unprecedented (a smoking gun for the veracity of the Ancient American Record).  What is objectively laudable would be laughable in 1830s America.  So the editorial board removes the name from the prophecy at publication.
- Colon was Jewish: a man among Gentiles.  In mathematics, the current language could imply either a Jew or Gentile, but given Colon's life and commentary about the Ancient Americans (look, they are clean-shaven and circumcised, all of them), Colon was Jewish during the Iberian era of the Inquisition.  Likely born in Barcelona, a member of the Colom family, the man made every effort to disassociate himself with his heritage.  Careful analysis of any original texts we have will demonstrate examples of phrases from the Catalan language.  What was his first name?  Well, to fit in, Cristóbal or Cristoforo is a nice Christian choice.  But of course, all of his original journals were curated and editorialized by Bartolomé de las Casas.  And, Colom commissioned this good friend to help craft a Christian theophany about the Crusades in the Holy Land.  And, Colom's sons on his death bed begged to know their true heritage, a secret Colom took to the grave.  Just imagine if the Mormon movement, even today, would exercise faith in anchoring to this frame.

#### Colon-mbia is apocalyptic
Colon-mbia literally means the arrival of Colon.  A fulfillment of the apocalyptic prophecy of Nephi:  in 2100 years, ships from the east (using our ship-building technology) will arrive and KILL YOU ALL.  Kafkaesque.  This is a very intriguing prophecy in essence.  Yet is shrowded with sunshine and rainbows in its editorialization:  Colon was inspired to come to this land and KILL YOU ALL; these liberated Gentiles were not all bad, they were seeking religious freedom so they came to America to KILL YOU ALL.  After the lens of editorialization is applied, the inconsistencies can be removed so serious discussion can follow.

#### Preparing for Colon-mbia
Nephi described this event to his children with a name and a timeframe: Colon will arrive (Colon-mbia) in 2100 years after Shazer (~1493).  Children would be ripped from their mothers and their heads smashed against stone/brick walls; daughters will be raped until sores/callouses develop; any efforts to negotiate and find commonality (your God visited us and this is what He taught) will result in torturous deaths.  What will you do?

- Option 1: we fight.  The original voyage of Colon was a disaster.  The three captains (and 90 men) had different objectives.  One captain was keen on prioritizing rape; he returned to Europe dying shortly thereafter from syphilis.  While this ship was gallivanting in absentia, the other two ships engaged an enemy and were summarily defeated; Colon's ship was forced onto a reef, ran aground, and eventually sunk.  And likely a few men died in the process.   A careful reading of the Doctor's diary on the second voyage reveals the official narrative of men left behind to secure a fort is very likely pure fiction.  Taking a few slave girls for ravaging, they returned to Europe.  Not Spain.  Colon arrived in Portugal as he wanted to avoid the financiers of his lost vessel.  Within six months, they were able to return to America with 17 ships and 1500 men.  And these slave girls were also useful for understanding a local 'lingua franca' that made communication with very distinct tribes possible throughout the Americas.  The maritime superiority that defeated Colon was never encountered again.  Although Colon actively looked for them.  They were gone.

- Option 2: we flight.  The above story is a hit-and-run, almost a scouting party.  After the encounter, this group likely went North to warn their cousins in Cahokia.  Maybe other messengers went South to warn the locals there as well.  And the flight to isolation began.  The people of Marajo vanish in the archeology.  Tairona and Machu Pichu seems to be the highlands-isolation strategy.  Another group blocks the Cayenne River (Cuyarí; there are two places with this name, one in Guiana and the other in the heart of Brasil; this example refers to the Brasilian river; the name commonality likely indicates diffusion and the direction of such diffusion would be from Brasil to Guiana) by chopping down large trees to damn access upstream; the Portuguese would name this river Madeira (meaning wood).

- Option 3: we fade to white.  The Americas may have had over 100 million people in 1491.  Most have painted the population desolation as an American Holocaust; that is, the killing and disease decimated the populations.  One interesting study among the Maya, however, suggests that the locals may have chose to stop having children.  Given the prophecy, do you want to be enslaved by the greedy colonists for generations, or do you just want to live a nice life, watch the sunset with your loved ones, and fade to white.

- Option 4: we proselyte.  The Book of Mormon is replete with stories of brave missionaries proselyting among their enemies.  The civilization was advanced, had the capability of trans-oceanic travel, and so this option was also likely exercised by some.  Maybe several different efforts.  Where did the Vikings come from?  How about the Anglo-Saxons?  Or the Franks?  Or the Slavs? Were these groups from America that decided to take the ministry to Europe: to build a society like Nephi did that would protect the innocent?
	
- Option 5: we embrace the blight.  One woodcarving suggests that suicide was a way out.  One example was a depiction of a beautiful, tall, naked blond woman that took a club and beat her infant daughter to death, told her boy to run off into the woods, and then hung herself.  Maybe this could be classified as a "flight", but maybe not.  Others would meet with the conquistadores trying to persuade them knowing hoping to bring out the goodness of men.  How many times did an initial meet-and-greet turn into a hostage situation?  This option is to embrace the blight as a learning experience.  To endure, bearing the burdens that were required, so that the prophecy of the scattering and the remnant would be fulfilled.  Mormon narrates that all of the pure-bloods were lost (which is unknowable suggesting another editorialization).  "All" was not absolute, a remnant of the descendants of Nephi exists today.  Because they chose to embrace the blight.

- Option 6: rebel out of spite.  It could be understandable how some would see this impending outcome as a curse for living in a society crafted by Nephi.  Such people may revert to other practices, may utilize knowledge about the details of the Messiah Death Event and hunt down and torture faithful believers in similar ways:  honor and bravery to anyone who could capture one of these 'good' men, forcing the good man to copulate with the sister (of the honored/brave) for a month, giving the good man small stones to throw at the crowds while the honored/brave man sneaks up behind the good man and bashes in his head with a club; or cutting a good man's throat from ear-to-ear on the altar of a temple; or severely mutilating the genitalia of a man before castrating; or forcing family and friends to eat the flesh of their fathers (several sources with the notable reference being Moroni 9).

#### Dynamics and Evolution of Options
Such an apocalyptic future would require careful consideration.  Quite possibly, different family units would have different perspectives on the issue based on their sense of mercy/justice and the purpose of life.  Some would anchor to a principle of non-violence, like the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi (geographic locator after first settlement in Jershon: East of lands of Nephi and Lehi, likely a river of refuge that Jehovah provides; SABA ANA) that took upon themselves the name of Ammon: AM-MON as in the PEOPLE of LOVE.  As descendants of Laman, when the people learned the teaching available to them, they made an oath of peace: MAA-KHERU becoming the people of peace: AM-MAA-KHERU (another meaning of America).  What exactly were they reading?  Was it the words "Captain" Moroni wrote on his cloak-turned-banner?  Was it prophecy regarding the nature of the upcoming Messiah Death Event?  Something like "no greater love than this, to lay down your life with your friends, for the benefit/salvation of your enemies."

![Peace](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/peace.png?raw=true) *Peace:*  A crown of innocence, an oath of truth, to establish law and order by laying down the spear forever.  Literal symbols, right example:  scimitar/scythe (to kill or harvest), true oath, bear/carry with arm, to put spear down.

kher sieve/mouth: to fall or defeat or slaughter 

beq = pregnant woman ... s'beg = make pregenant ... sabacka = doggy style ...

 kha = sieve/hand ... king's coronation 
 
 am = what is in, who is in 
 
 

Interestingly, this people chose to give up fighting forever (something a cousin Chief Joseph would say hundreds of years later).  At the same time, Captain Moroni was demanding soldiers from the various tribes enlist.  In fact, when one group choose not to fight, he killed them.  So the AM-MON were under pressure to fight, yet an oath was made.  Seemingly, the sons were strongly encouraged to not take the same oath and enlist.  Two thousand young boys, that following the tradition of the founder Nephi, chose to go and do, as they had faith in the teachings of their mothers.  

The editorialization of Moroni: if all men were like unto this man, the very gates of hell.... is an interesting data point.  At first glance, this seems to be commentary made by the curator Mormon, who was also a naval captain.  Yet, given the complexity of killing one group who chose not to fight while NOT killing another group, the complexity of Mormon's inclusion is much more robust.  All anchored to alliteration around the "kh" sound that culimates with Khori-khor (Korihor) which may literally mean upside-down.  Can you consider the likelihood that the "gates of hell" was NOT Mormon's editorialization but Sidney's?  Therein, is a path forward.  Maybe the reason the city of Moroni (a tor-tor city) was buried in the ocean was a cosmic message to indeed 'bury weapons of war' forever.  Maybe as Mormon was reviewing the end of his civilization, he was reflecting on a significant change point that Korihor illucidates:  Moroni kills one group that won't fight, yet gives refuge to another group that won't fight.  I do not believe I have ever heard this theme in a conference talk or Sunday School lesson.  How intriguing such an objective analysis this would be.

Even if the "editorialization" does belong to Mormon, should we read it and agree with the commentator?  Or should we carefully study the narrative in its entirety and arrive at our own conclusions.  Was Pahoran a greater man of integrity than Captain Moroni?  From your own worldview, regardless of what Mormon or Rigdon or Oaks wants you to see!

In addition, another significant change point in tribal option formation would be the Messianic visit after the destruction of certain types of cities:  cities of war, cities of exploiting the poor, and cities engaging in surgeries.  The common denominator seems to be those that try and play God by controlling outcomes for others.  That is, those that boast of their own strength or arrogantly define to God, the potter, how the creation actually occurred (see Isaiah).

After the destruction, three voices are heard with time gaps between each:  first, an angry masculine voice with a laundry-list of "wo"; second, an objective feminine voice reminding those listening about the desire to nurture like a bird protects the eggs and nourishes the young chicks; third, a raspy/aspira feminine voice (still and quiet) introducing the appearance of her Son.  This Son descends from the heavens, teaches the people, and then invites others from the celestial domain to minister to the people as He declares:  "Behold, your little ones."  So three voices were heard, a Son appears, followed by a concourse of celestials (possibly 5000 'disciples').  What exactly was taught by this group to the people and the little ones.  We do not know exactly, but this change point would most certain influence and update a family tribe's perspective on which of the options would best align with their specific family beliefs.

### The Nature of Innovation
Innovation diffuses.  If the new idea has value for society, it will flourish.  One can study the diffusion of a technology over time to understand the source and advancement.  A technology can be man-made such as ship-building or earth-moving capabilities.  A technology can be man-diffused such as the transplant of flora/fauna using the capability of trans-oceanic travel associated with ship-building (date palms, papyrus tor-tor, holly berry, cassava, saccharum, coca, kava, liana/caapi, cacao, coffee, walnut,  Ungulates, Primates, Pantheras, Capras, Equus, Bos, Camelidae, Aves).  And of course, a technology can be merely an old technology taken to a new land (metallurgy, glass-making, weaving of linen, pottery, brick-making, concrete [titi or teet-teet], and so on).  Likely, many such technologies were developed in ancient Egypt (and improved upon by the House of Jacob, specifically, the son Joseph).

#### Lone Genius: rare reality among ethnocentric grandeur
A lone genius is unprecedented and unique.  A human that enables humanity to advance to new shores in economics, societal structure, or religion.  I would classify Nephi as a lone genius.  He likely had a set of gifts to enable him to do the deeds of his lifetime, yet he did more than any other without a significant amount of help from the knowledge stores of his society.  Certainly, he had some knowledge of metallurgy possibly because this was a family trade; possibly the renovation of the temple was a construction project that Nephi's father was involved in.  Eventually, Nephi would have access to the sacred texts found on the brass plates, which likely contained content today we would call math/science.    And Nephi may have observed the shipping-merchant system first hand in southern Arabia.  Yet, when Nephi innovated, it was unique and novel.  His ship, likely a catamaran with planked hulls (e.g., a first house boat similar to the Drua), was unlike anything others in the field of domain had ever done.  A radical innovation that literally carried a group to new shores: the "Lehi" prophesy.  There was not a precedented human source that could explain this genius.

The lone genius is a rarity.  

##### Great synthesizers
Many others have been propped up within their ethnocentric centers as lone genius, yet few can truly be identified as having no preceding knowledge.  Others, the great synthesizers (Archimedes, Leonardo Da Vinci/Galileo, Einstein), were capable of configuring the knowledge available for them to transform world constructs yet were not creators of new, innovative concepts.    

##### Mediocre imitators 
And then, there are those that utilize normative power structures to 'stand on the shoulders of giants' and self-proclaim greatness, the imitators:  Euclid, Newton, Edison.  They take credit for the work of others.  And utilize social status to hinder their innovative sources.  As Einstein appropriately noted:  "Great spirits have always suffered violent opposition from mediocre minds."

##### Sourcing Innovation
When Alexander the Macedonian "conquered" the Indus Valley civilization (that had lived without walls or armies), Vedic knowledge flowed into the Greek domain.  The Oracle of Delphi was run by the Vedic sages.  And suddenly mathematics, philosophy, and ethics proliferate.  That is, the knowledge-spillover planted seeds that sprouted and flourished.  

Similarly, Colon-mbia happened and knowledge flooded into Europe.  Many countries tried to keep secret what they were learning, and to counter this, spies were embedded in various conquistador adventures.  Knowledge was power.  And, it would seem, the free-trade zone for sharing this knowledge was northern Italy.  The Medici family was curating and diffusing the knowledge triggering the Renaissance.  Galileo was able to synthesize astronomy and geometry to demonstrate the foundations of modern physics (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo).  Finally, following the deepest penetration of the conquests (in the Americas, in Africa, and in India), the great mathematics appear in Europe: algebra, solutions to the brachistochrone problem (fluxions AKA calculus), number theory, and so on.


##### Application:  Portuguese Maritime Genius
When one studies the diffusion of innovation, the source of innovation must always be identified.  For example, the Veneticians had a long history of building boats for defense and trade.  So, when the Portuguese end up pillaging and plundering the free-trade zone of the Indian Ocean, many local leaders would seek out the wisdom and technology of the Veneticians.  To no avail.  The technology they were facing was new and novel to the world.  Or at least to the known world.

The Muslims would call the ship the the "qaraqir" (the dread of the merchant ports, literally the wall-buster:  qara-qir = tear to pieces [H7167] - walls [H7023]) which became standardized as the carraca and carrack.  The ship was made from thick timbers so could withstand significant cannon fire.  It had a very low draft which enabled it to carry lots of cargo, but more importantly made it very stable in storms.  It would not tip over.  Yet, this could also be its weakness, in the correct circumstances; by forcing the ship into shallow waters, it would easily run aground (as Colon's Santa Maria did on his first voyage; as if Colon was a neophyte with the ship technology who encountered a superior navy that recognized the design and its weakness).  From this radical innovation, incremental improvements would be made, namely a ship that was shallower on the draft and more maneuverable; that is a caravel (qara-vel).

So where did this engineering innovation come from?  There is no long history of ship building like the Phoenicians and Venetians had.  How did a small Iberian country suddenly become a plundering giant?  The details are a mystery, but after the introduction of the ship, the Portuguese created a School of Navigation and kept many of their voyages and ship-building technologies secret.  Again, that informs the acquisition of a novel technology yet does NOT demonstrate the Portuguese created the technology.  The name for the ship may have been Nao or Nau or Não, which sounds a lot like the word "Noah" who anciently was known for building a thick-timbered vessel. And maybe be a derivative of "Nafi" from which the word "navigate" may have originated.

King John of Portugual seemingly decided to use this design to plunder, starting with North Africa in 1415.   At the time, the power of the technology was not fully understood as the King tried to land and engage the enemies.  Over time, the Não would just bombard the target until the conditions of surrender were met, reducing the need for soldiers (paying, feeding, burying them), and maximizing the ability to plunder.  And so begins the conquest of the free-trade center of the Indian Ocean.  An area that experienced relatively peaceful trade for over 2000 years.

Sailing around Africa was a challenge until two Portuguese navigators decided to sail west to catch a trade wind that would then take them south and then return east.  Interesting capability that just appears.  And this unique trade secret occurs at about 30-degrees south latitude.  It is estimated that before the Portuguese signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, they were well-aware of the region we today call Brasil.

All of the mystery behind the masterful maritime genius could be explained by a society that had over 2000 years of expertise in the ship-building ecosystem, the people of Nephi.  The people of Nephi, in an effort to thwart the inevitable, may have enabled it.  Maybe they wrecked a ship along the Iberian coastline.  Or maybe, in a missionary effort, they arrived in port to meet with the local kings.  

##### Colon-mbia: glass beads and sea shells
Colon arrives in America and notices how friendly the locals are and how willing they are to exchange goods for glass beads or seashells.  What he did not understand that these small items were tokens of a fiat economy, a simple token of currency NOT anchored to gold/silver which is so easily pillaged in transport.  Interestingly, one again needs to consider the source of innovation.

Q: Where and when did glass develop for the production of glass beads?  

The "historian" will answer: from Venice, of course.  Technically, from the island of Murano to reduce the risk of fire on the main island.  

Q: Well, what defines "Murano glass"?  
A: A specific mixture of silica with bicarbonate.  

Q: And did Venice develop this technology?  
A: Well no, the bicarbonate was sourced from the Levant and the technique may date back to Egypt from about 3000 BC.  

Q: Has archaelogists discovered glass beads in Ancient America?
 
A: Yes, but it all came from Colon.  

Q: How do you know?  
A: Well, these 'dumb locals' did not have the skills to make it.  

Q: Well then, why did they value it?  Would that not imply a past-knowledge of the thing, which maybe was lost to them?  
A: No, of course not.  No one was able to melt sand to form glass until 3000 BC.   There is no way the Ancient Americans had developed that skill before 1500 AD yet lost the capability.

In summary, this is called "colonialism history/archaelogy" anchored to a specific worldview where what is being discovered aligns with ethnocentrism.  Such capability seemed to be lost by some of the locals in Ancient Americans, but not all.  Ironically, in an effort to demonstrate the fiction of significant 'land migrations over the Bering Strait' to counter the obvious trans-oceanic possibility, archaelogists discovered glass beads in Alaska.  The "Murano" brand, dated in the 1400s, before Colon-mbia.  But the "Murano" brand is actually not Venetian in origin - it is Egyptian!
	
###### Cahokia
The levels of 'colonial distortion' may be too complex to unwind.  Consider Cahokia.  Which may be "KiasKiasKiah" based on a local Alogonquin tribe.  There are several potential meanings of either root, using ancient Egyptian.  Fundamentally, it would seem that the area had a large mound which would demarcate a boundary or territory.  Likely a banner was unfurled across this large mound.  Across the way, in modern-day Saint Louis, it is reported that there was another such large mound, likely a little bit further from shore than the Gateway Arch.  This mound, like many of its neighbors was ploughed under and demolished to build the city.  Along with approximately 200,000 other mounds that stretched from Cahokia to Upstate New York.  

Each of these large mounds would be tied to a specific river branch, demonstrating a confluence.  A visual marker that enabled navigators on the rivers to understand where they were headed.  And so, the primary cultures would have a land of inheritance:  possibly the Lakota/Dakota north along one river system (Ta means Land in Egyptian).  Or the Adena/Hopewell peoples of "Ohio" which is above the Port we call Louisville today.  That is, the Ohio river is impassable due to Falls, so that region north would be an isolate.  However, the Tennessee River valley would represent its own watershed which interestingly almost connects with the Alabama River system that feeds the Gulf of Mexico and the Savannah/Samtee River systems that feed the Altantic Coast.  These highland areas have a few surving raised-earth works which likely consisted of a wood-henge which could be used as a map to quickly ascertain latitude.

The Cahokia complex has the most robust remainder of such wood henges.  One circle has 28 posts on the periphery: very useful to mark the phases of the moon.  Four other circles seem to have been found: 12, 24, 36, and 60 posts.  Useful for dividing the year.  And one circle that has been partially destroyed may have had 72 or 75 posts:  very useful for tracking Lyra Comet 1P.

For ancients, there was only one cardinal direction: East.  This is where the sun was born to give life to each day.  If you put a wooden post in the ground, you can see easily follow the shadow and the light.  In the northern hemisphere, the sun always is to the south and the shadow is to the north.  That is, the second cardinal dimension is a function of the first, the sun.  On the summer solstice, the shadow at mid-day (a function of a minimum shadow, often referred to as solar noon) can be measured to determine what we today call latitude.  So for example, if you are at the Equator, on the summer solstice, there will be no shadow at solar noon.  You are at 0-degree latitude.  At Cahokia, this angle would be approximately 38.65 degrees.

Any skilled outdoorsman can find true north (shadow north) and therefore the remaining cardinal directions by observing the sun and the shadow path for less than an hour.  Maybe that should be updated to:  any skilled outsdoorsman used to be able to find true north ....

Placing 36 posts in a circle will enable more sophisticated calculations, literally dividing a year into 10-day periods (with an extra 5.2422 days that would need to be addressed optimally at the end of normal 360 days, epagomenal days 'outside of time').  One could divide the year into 2 parts, 3 parts, 4 parts, 6 parts, 12 parts, and so on.  If the height of the post is known, the interplay of the shadows may allow one to ascertain latitude quite quickly.  And with a defined prime meridian and a few other data points, longitude can also be derived.  So, for navigation purposes, at a highland where several river systems meet, or at a confluence of two river systems, having a raised earth work with a wood-henge would enable one to "ubicarse" (to understand where in geography you are) similar to a mall-map.  You are here.  If you want to go visit the Lakota cousins, follow that river system.

At the moment, Cahokia seems to me to be a gathering place that was an education and reunion center.  And of course, a burial center.  With a belief that "hell" is defined as "SHE-OL" (the pit), it seems obvious that the burial of the dead above ground was to get them closer to the heavens.  Some burials throughout the Americas demonstrated an embalming process, but positioned in a sitting position unlike the classic Egyptian Pharoahs which lay reposed.  Often wrapped in flaxen cord (not linen bandages), some embalmed "mummies" in America are so well preserved that anti-biotic residues were discovered in the stomach remains.

Of course, archaeologists, with their "colonist lens" and hoping to get a click-bait headline with their research, will often conclude that any burial site must be tied to "human sacrifice" or cannibalism.  Certainly, they have get on their "jump-to-conclusions" mat several times to arrive there.  But it gets them noticed.

Cahokia is one such example.  Cahokia springs to life after the 1066 appearance of Lyra Comet 1P.  And Cahokia seemingly vanishes in the window of two other appearances of the comet (1378/1456).  If there was a 2100-year Colon-mbia prophecy, maybe this was a final meeting of the cousins to celebrate what was, before preparing for what will be.  In this context, the location of the other mounds adjacent to the larger mound may be a memorial in the form of a map.  If some believers are killed in a skirmish with another tribe, maybe the dead (or dying) are carried by boat to Cahokia to be buried in the region that corresponds to where they lived (in relation to the Cahokia location).  That is, a miniaturization of the lands and territories.  Or, if a village is raided to steal the young girls from the House of Virgins, and their tribe practices Option 5 (similar to a fire drill):  if the enemy tribes capture you, they will do horrible things to you, so if the men fail defending the village, here is a piece of linen, tie it to a rafter, and hang yourself.  If true, the value of the village attack has been lost to the invaders, so they would leave.  Thereafter, the young girls would be carried by ship to Cahokia and buried, virtue intact.

And so, one can explain the same archaelogy from a very different perspective.  And one should not judge which option a specific tribe chose to embrace for Colon-mbia.  Some, it would seem, chose suicide as a path forward.  Others embraced the opportunity to learn from the life presented them.  It has been said that Carib invaders would capture the Taíno daughters.  And so, these women would be carried to a Caribbean island, raising children and living a reasonable life.  Not an ideal life, but nonetheless, alive.  And these women would teach their sons and daughters their language, which preserves the heritage of the Taíno.  "Los sobreviviente" that place survival first.  Another reasonable option.

#### Alexander the Macedonian 
Certainly to the people of Nephi, the cycles of the Comet Lyra 1P would be carefully observed, but what of others within the Hebrew tradition?  After the Josiah comet appearance (614 BC), it would seem that the astrologers did track this important comet.  In fact, the Jewish community linked its appearance to the rise of Greek influence in the region at the hands of Alexander the Macedonians.  Historians want to date this moment at 323 BC, but Jewish tradition anchors to the appearance of the comet in 312 BC.  Both could be correct if you see the comet as an indicator of change that is impending.  Or if there were also two markers:  the cyclical comet and another celestial event.

Was the Josiah appearance the first of Lyra Comet 1P?  Or were there more ancient appearances as a sign from the heavens of change on earth?  Maybe the fall of the Northern Kingdom was anchored to the appearance of the comet.  Maybe Solomon's triumph of his naval alliances with Saba to open trade routes through the Jaws of Aden (aka 'Irreantum').  Or the Exodus.  Or Joseph's success in Egypt to preserve life against a famine.  And against more destruction by sealing up the tower of confusion and removing the desolation instrument with his bones out of Egypt.  Or maybe, as observed by the Chinese, the comet made its first appearance with the meteor showers from Lyra.  That the Josiah appearance was the first.  At this point, it is uncertain.  Enough data is not available.   But certainly for the people of Nephi it was significant.  A marker to ascertain the Messianic birth.

### Messianic Age
The Messiah was born 5 April 8 BC, the year of the Water Ox, 15 days after the solar year begins (Nowruz) defined by an equinox.  A few years prior, as a omen of change, Lyra Comet 1P appears in 12 BC.  And to commemorate the Messianic birth, a supernova occurs, which the Chinese have defined as QingMing.  Of course, this could iterate and update if better data surfaces.

#### Death Date: Internal Views 
If the Messiah only lived 33 years, the death would be about 26 AD.  According to one supposition of Roman "history", in 26 AD Pontius Pilate is appointed prefect, Tiberius retires, and Jesus was crucified.  Based on other narrations regarding timelines associated with John the Baptist, 7 April 30 AD and 3 April 33 AD are also internal candidates.  Of course, many theories to fit into these timelines are significantly flawed.  For example, the timing of the Passover was a function of the moon as dictated by the local authorities.  For example, if there was a major renovation in Jerusalem and the city was not ready for the influx of devoutees, it is possible that whimsically Passover would be pushed back a month.  Not common, but very plausible according to Jewish traditions.  In addition, the timelines are all anchored to a 7-day week based on the Roman Catholic traditions of the Holy Week.  Rome did not adopt the 7-day week until 100 AD, so any such speculation is an anachronism.  Ancient Egypt had 10-day "weeks" called decans, Genesis 1 has God "saying" about 10 times, your hands have 10 digits, Paul had visited more than the 7 churches highlighted in Revelation.  If editorialization did occur in traditional Judeo-Christian writings, numbers are one of the easiest things to alter.  As my journey of discovery has me conclude when reflecting on the 3 Nephi chronology.  

Isaiah makes it evident that God is tired of the lunations and sacrifices.  Maybe that implies that a lunar (luni-solar) calendar had replaced the older, traditional solar calendar.  Maybe there was a 7-day week during Isaiah's lifetime; certainly there were diplomatic ties with northern traditions that anchored to 7: likely starting with the Sumerian/Akkadian traditions.  The Egyptians also venerated the 7 sacred cows as well, representing the stars of the pleides; that is, the 7 sisters.  Four cycles of 7 is approximately one cycle of the moon.   So was Isaiah recognizing that Akkadian traditions had infiltrated his society in 700 BC.  Does that imply that previously time had been anchored to the sun, 36 decans per year.  Regardless, as one develops a frame of study, absolutisms like "God created the earth in 7 days" should be softened:  "God or one or more gods participated in (or commissioned) the placement of life during number of periods."

#### Death Date: External Anchor
The Messiah Death Event culminated with the Messianic death on 5 May 31 AD.  This is anchored to a testimony of a Chinese Emperor who observed a solar eclipse, proclaiming that a "man from heaven had died" and entered his private palacial chambers for 5 days.  Possibly the date was 31 AD described as the "summer, in fourth month of the year, on the day of Ren Wu."  NASA has developed algorithms to estimate historic eclipse events.  Fred Espenak's assumptions predict that an eclipse with 4 minutes, 26 seconds of totality appeared over the Sea of Japan on 10 May 31 AD.  Occuring about 1 PM in China, this event would have been partially seen in the Levant at about 8 AM.   As all predictions are shrouded with some degree of uncertainty, I will anchor to May but choose specifically, for now, 5 May 31 AD.

My selection of 5 May 31 AD is a placeholder, a best guess at the moment; as is the placeholder of 5 April 8 BC.  Taken together, the Messiah would have lived a life of 37 years, 30 days.

### Impasse: 33 or 37?
My conclusions that the Messiah died at the age of 37 is in direct conflict with the timeline presented in 3 Nephi which summarily concluded that the Messiah died at the age of 33.  A clear impasse, especially for a mathematician.

Royal Skousen had commented that Oliver would be tricky, and Joseph was constantly reviewing changes he was making.  A careful review of the manuscript data does indicate that at least one of the dates in the 3 Nephi narrative was crossed out and replaced.  I had not considered that the entire publication process was an editorialized expansion of an original text.  Yet, the mathematics is undeniable.
