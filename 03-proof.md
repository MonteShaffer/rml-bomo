## Proof the underlying text is an Ancient American Record 

When you discuss 'burden of proof', where does the burden fall?  The antagonists try to frame the argument illogically.  Either the antagonist is intentionally being obtuse or the antagonist is ignorant to the falsification principle (aka the "Black Swan" problem):  Just because you have never seen a black swan, that does not mean they don't exist.  Scholars in academia do not like this logic frame as it challenges most of their conclusions; most especially among social scientists.  Karl Popper pointed this logical fallacy out to the research community in the 1970s and many published research articles still violate this fundamental principle.   

In context of the Book of Mormon, antagonists try to switch the frame using anachronistic arguments about horses or steel or (insert anachronism here).  An apologist gets trapped into attempts on defending every anachronism or inconsistency.  This is the fatal flaw of the apologist.  

The Book of Mormon as a thing exists.  The Black Swan exists!  Maybe it is full of blemishes, yet it exists.  As an antagonist, the burden is to demonstrate how this exists.  As Joseph Smith offered one explanation, the burden of proof is to offer a counter-explanation.  If Joseph was a master magician that has not revealed his secrets, the antagonist must "pull back the curtain" and expose him as a charlatan.

### Context of 1800s America 
Certainly, many contemporaries were trying to explain the unexplainable: over 200,000 earth mounds of varying sizes littered the lands from the Ohio River valley to upstate New York.  Thomas Jefferson carefully excavated a portion of one earthwork found on his property and concluded it was a burial mound that contained about 1000 souls.  

Grave robbers would at times find valuable artifacts with a cadaver within a mound.  Any treasure find would spread rapidly, and the failures would be forgotten.  And likely, an industry of gold-diggers would emerge.  'There are thousands of options, where should we dig?  Maybe the Spanish later buried treasure in these earth works.  But which one?'  And if you failed at finding treasure in one dig, a simple excuse would be that the spirits protecting the treasure moved it.  

This society of treasure hunters was a very different class of citizenry than, for example, Thomas Jefferson.  Rationalism and careful science was NOT driving the worldview of those seeking wealth by digging a hole.  Yet, everyone was trying to make sense of what existed: (1) why there were so many of these earthworks; (2) how were they constructed;  (3) 'since it is obvious these "dumb Indians" were incapable of such marvels', another group must have built them, but who; (4) who then are these "Indians": are they savages or noble? 

Before they were all ploughed under and forgotten, several literary attempts to explain these realities is not surprising.  The quality of such efforts varied significantly.  Although Mark Twain would disagree, the "Last of the Mohicans" published in 1826, was an example of a quality literary effort.  Much better than, for example, "View of the Hebrews".   Regardless, a plagiarism challenge for the Book of Mormon is likely the weakest of arguments from an antagonist.  Any serious student will dismiss the Solomon Spaulding or Captain Kidd or View of Hebrews (or even Last of the Mohicans).  Computational linguistics (using latent semantic analysis, cosine similarity for document correlations) is one area of personal expertise, and nothing significant in this literary comparison has merit.  (If Sidney augmented the narrative and gave permission for his authorship to remain anonymous, even the "editorialization thesis" would not be considered plagiarism.)



### Joseph Smith as translator or author 
So the antagonists must conclude that Joseph Smith invented the content as an author possibly sprinkling in ideas from the era in which he lived.  Without any attempt to refute the "Ancient American Record" dimension, the conclusion is merely "Joseph authored this, he did NOT translate anything."  Where is the proof of this conclusion?  In fact, if one carefully considers the logical frame of falsification, antagonists have no argument (they are declaring the "Black Swan" does not exist).  Even if Joseph Smith invented the entire narrative, where did these ideas come from?  Information-processing theory can propose various internal source mechanics, but the foundation of anything innovative from an individual is that it is idiosyncratic.  That is, how Joseph received the innovative content would be unique to him.  Maybe it was "all in his head" which he perceived to be a "translation process from a spiritual domain" but the fact remains:  the Book of Mormon exists.  

#### Comparison to Samuel Clemens 
Consider, for example, the creation narrative "Extracts from Adam's Diary" written by Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain). The narrative exists and seems to have contextual correlation to the classic Judeo-Christian Genesis story.  

Q:  Did Clemens 'plagiarize' the Bible?  
A:  Of course not!  However, the content of his narrative demonstrates his knowledge of biblical traditions.  Therefore, based on the nature of the author (an intellectual), we conclude this text is a parody full of humor and irony.  These are all interpretations we impose on the text.  And if we were to ask the author the intent, he would likely agree.  

Q:  So where did the ideas and words come from?  
A:  From the author's mind of course.  

Q:  How?  
A:  And, as they say, "Ay, there's the rub!"  It is unknowable how the mind of an author actually develops creative content.  This specific author was hyper-intellectual, yet that does NOT help clarify how ideas are generated within a homo sapien.  It is unknowable.

Now, let's compare the men.  Joseph's opus, the Book of Mormon, was published when he was 25 years old.  Clemens' opus, Huck Finn, took 7 years to write with two bursts of creativity with significant silence between them, was a continuation of Tom Sawyer, and was published when he was over 40 years old (after visiting Utah and reading the Book of Mormon).  Joseph was not an intellectual like Samuel Clemens.  Joseph's upbringing was more spiritually anchored (folksy) where sharing visions/dreams was normative behavior.  Clemens' upbringing was in a home with a father who practiced the law; a home where rationality, pragmatism, and logic were likely the normative behavior.  Samuel had significant literary skill which Joseph lacked.  Yet, Joseph had innovative content that Samuel could never match.  Samuel's writings are always anchored to the familiar: the Genesis story, life on the Mississippi, the slavery phenomenon, and even a Yankee in King Arthur's Court.  That is, Samuel has to anchor to the concrete to use his literary skills and intellect.  His genius was in the reconfiguration of existing content often classified as a form of incremental innovation.  Joseph Smith has no such anchors for his "imaginative ancient history" (as later described by Clemens) which would be classified as a form of radical innovation.  And likely, this is why the Book of Mormon annoys so many antagonists.  It is an anomaly.  An outlier.  How could so many unique/distinct ideas be thrown together into one text?  This baffles them.  

### Antagonist's Dilemna
So antagonists get trapped into a dilemna.  Do they anchor to Mark Twain's conclusion that the literary essence of the Book of Mormon is "chloroform in print"?  Or was Joseph Smith a genius in his ability to embed chiasmic poetry?    
#### Chiasmus
Chiasmus is a Hebraic poetic form.  And may provide sufficient  evidence that the Book of Mormon contains an Ancient American Record that was translated.  The best two examples of such structure is the King Benjamin speech (see Mosiah 2-5) and Alma's letter to his faithful son Helaman (Alma 36).  That does NOT mean these chiasmic structures did not face editorialization; very likely they did.  But was the chiasmic structure evidence of ancient literature or genius editors?  Maybe Joseph Smith or Oliver Cowdery or Sidney Rigdon had access to a book at a local library that defined chiastic structures.  Maybe.  But that doesn't enable them to be able to create chiasmic forms.  I can read the Sonnets of Shakespeare and understand the formation critera of pentameter and versification, that does not make it possible for me to create a good sonnet that is consistently themed.

Chiasmus and its use was internally consistent within the complex storyline of many distinct peoples.  In fact, an important introduction to chiasmus occurs at a significant internal change point.  The people of Nephi spoke the Egyptian language and had the learning of the Hebrews (e.g., PUCARA, not PETRA).  The people of Mulek were nobles and likely were educated in many languages:  Egyptian, Hebrew, Phoenician, Assyrian, and Babylonian with Hebrew being the primary language.  However, this group did not have any significant written records with them so relied on oral traditions, likely Hebrew traditions (e.g., PISGAH, not MIGDAL) to preserve cultural memory.  Over 300 years later, these two societies collided.  Now, when these two societies merge into one, there will be knowledge spillover and adoption.  The people of Nephi have written records, advanced weaponry and a superior economic system.  So naturally, they become the rulers following the merger.  The people of Mulek were from the house of Judah who historically carries the scepter.  As such, although initially yielding, many of the house of Judah had no interest of being ruled by the teaching-class from the house of Joseph.  The kingmen rebellion will demonstrate this cultural-heritage conflict.    With all of that being said, King Benjamin used chiasmic structure in his famous speech: likely as a sign of good will to connect the two traditions.  Maybe chiasmic structure existed before among the people of Nephi (e.g., the Book of Lehi), but with the data we have, it seems to be that the joining of the people of Mulek with the people of Nephi was indeed a change point.  That is, the internal record has no chiasmus, the peoples merge, and now chiasmus appears.  This literary style being most prominent immediately following the merger.  Maybe a linguistic Eureka moment for the people of Nephi reminding them of their poetic heritage.

#### Chloroform
Mark Twain visited Utah in the 1860s, bought a Book of Mormon, devoured it, and concluded that it was "chloroform in print."  At the time, chloroform was just being developed for commercialization as a inhalant anesthesia: Twain's comment demonstrates his intellect and wit.  That is, the book would put you to sleep.  Repetitive and pretentious.  A confluence (Twain labels a mongrel) of an imaginary history weaved into Biblical norms.  'The ancient [imaginary history] is constrained and confused:  is it intended to be simple or have gravitas?'  

This critique is fascinating and insightful:  demonstrating both the intellectual capabilities of the critic as well as his literary prowess.  However, to me, the criticism further supports the idea that the Book of Mormon was a mixture of two distinct elements: something ancient (described as imaginary by Twain) and something contemporary that was glib, pontificated, verbose, repetitive, and pretentious.  

### Mixture-module Hypothesis
Mark Twain was brilliant, concise, and thorough in his book review.  And his conclusions align with the premise of this treatise to explain the Book of Mormon origins:  there was a source that got editorialized as a manuscript was created. What Mark Twain describes as an imaginary ancient history developed by the author, the author  (Joseph Smith) describes as being received through spiritual means.  Those views are not competing; they are, in fact, directionally consistent.  Since human perception is idiosyncratic, what Twain understood to be author's imaginations was considered spiritual guidance by Joseph.  Potato, Tomato!  And as we will discover with the proof below, Mark Twain saw something ancient that he considered 'imagination undeveloped' from a literary perspective.  If, in fact, it was a translation, not a composition, such simplicity would be inherent.

#### Mormon origins 
Mormon wrote a letter to his son Moroni sharing that he (Mormon) finally figured out what his name (Mormon) meant.  Before this letter, the father described himself as Mormon, the son of Mormon, named after the Waters of Mormon (the story of Alma).  Now, he writes to his son the meaning of his name.  What changed?  Mormon discovered and read the small plates of Nephi.  Not included in the publication of the Book of Mormon, but shared by Joseph Smith to many devotees, Mormon means the good love or God's love.  Seemingly the debate during the editorialization process may have gone like this:  'Mormon is the name of the author of the book, it does not mean God's love Joseph.  Charity means God's love!'

So it would seem, Joseph relented.  And Sidney Rigdon, steeped in the Pauline epistles and traditional wisdom, took it upon himself to expand the original terse letter between a father and son: "dear son, I figured out that my name Mormon means God's love or the good love.  love, dad".  A classic Sidney introjection, demonstrating his acumen with Pauline philosophy expands the letter:  "Charity is the pure love of Christ..."  What Sidney considered Christian clever may be the essence of what Clemens considered self-aggrandizing, 'modern' glib, repetitive of the New Testament.

The simplicity of the original authentic dialogue is what I want to read.  One day.  And I imagine the gravitas that is currently lacking will be significant and profound.  Once the "editorialization" layer is removed.  And Egyptian literary forms are understood.

#### Mormon's genealogy and language 

Another significant change point for Mormon was an understanding of his genealogy.  Before, he proudly declares "I am a descendant of Lehi" (3 Nephi).  Then, following the Mosiah-priority of the translation order, he discovers the small plates.  Now, he declares "I am a descendant of Nephi" (Words of Mormon).  So what did Mormon read to inform this change?  Something clarified the exact genealogy, but what was it?  Where did it go?  Why would it be editorialized?  Nephi already had lied, deceived, stoled, and killed, what would be the harm of revealing he also lived a polyamorous life, taking one of Sam's daughters to wife?

So it would seem, Mormon was descended from one of Sam's daughters.  Likely, the pure-blood line was exhausted, so Am-moron, the last of the people of Moron, allowed Mormon to be the guardian of the records.  Not a perfect blood-line match, but at least a direct descendant from Lehi.  Since such matriarchal genealogies are a function of women (as trees of life), makes you reconsider the gender of several key actors in the story.  It would seem that Nephi's first wife was "Moron" (see H4824, 'joyful laughter') and the keeper of the record were the descendants of this woman.  Or maybe Nephi's mother was named "Moron".  Consider some examples:  Am-mon (people of love), Am-moron (people of joy), Am-mulek (people of mulek), Am-malch-iah (people of Jehovah's king / people of king's brother), Am-ack-iah (people of brother's brother).  Am-moron was possibly a generic title for the keeper of the records, an emphasis that this guardian was in fact, a literal descendent of Nephi through this Moron.  Maybe this information was in the Book of Lehi or the Legend of Nephi originally.  But would an 1820s editorialization remove this name?  Most likely yes.  Again, something that is laudable as an accurate translation would be laughable by the standards of the time.  

Mormon also made it very clear that language  was constantly evolving (devolving).  Mormon, living about 600 years after the people of Nephi (Egyptian language) merged with the people of Mulek (Hebrew language), concluded that the current language form would not be understood by the ancient groups.  Yet interestingly, when Mormon discovers the small plates, it seems as if he is easily able to understand the most ancient form of the language.  Was Mormon able to read the narrative of Lehi so easily as well?  Or would it be like reading Beowulf in the old English?

#### Joseph Smith's esoteric perspective  

Taken altogether, I have included the stem [mor-mon-ya] in my estimation of the first phrase written by Nephi in his small plates, the legend of Nephi.  This specific inclusion certainly would have captured Mormon's attention.  And it is a reference to Egyptian mythology that we (humans) are descended from the celestial (the gods) who came on one or more vessels (boats or ships) from a sacred pure water (lake) in the highlands.  A much different view of our origins than a modern Judeo-Christian norm.

Certainly Joseph Smith was engaged in expanding Judeo-Christian views of his era:  [elohim] as a plurality of gods, eternal progression to become a god, and the glory of god being the experience and learning obtained in this life (very gnostic).  Very far removed from a monotheistic view that evolved (or devolved) following the Messiah Death Event; of which, the Masoretes were intentional in removing the notion of polytheism in their efforts to preserve their legacy and remain relevant.  Many of Joseph's views could be today classified as western esoteric or gnostic:  knowledge is the key to power as Nephi's brother so carefully summizes:  "Oh be wise, what more can I say?"

Interesting, there are many "poly" innovations (restorations) that Joseph Smith suggested:  polytheism, polygenesis, polyamory to name the big 3.  If Nephi had these concepts ingrained in his worldview and writings, were they blatantly removed by the intellectualism of Sidney replaced with the classic monotheistic, mono-genesis, monogamous views of 1820s Christianity?


#### Joseph Smith, after the publication 
Joseph Smith's behavior, after the publication, is an important marker in trying to discern the source for the Book of Mormon.  

Joseph was both ignorant and brilliant:  he would voice new ideas that amazed and inspired yet did not know the city of Jerusalem was surrounded by walls.  In a safe environment, surrounded by a man he admired for his intellect and integrity (Frederick Granger Williams), Joseph would engage in gospel-study sessions.  

Frederick was described as a physician, having moved to Kirtland in about 1830.  He owned a decent parcel of land and gifted Joseph a tract with a house.  Seemingly, the men got along very well and would spend a lot of time together.  By 1832, Frederick was officially appointed as Joseph's scribe before becoming a member of the First Presidency the next year.  Joseph seemed to enjoy Frederick's company in early-morning scripture studies, describing him as:  quiet, extremely intelligent, and humble.


##### Studying Book of Mormon Geography 
One study topic was related to geography.  Frederick was a former barge captain and understood a bit about ships and maps.  So together they would read excerpts of the Book of Mormon, open contemporary maps, and would try to understand the movements of Nephi early in the story.  That is, they were reading it as source material NOT as something Joseph himself invented!

For example, they concluded in 1833 that at about 19 degrees north latitude, the family ([Lehi's Travels](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/59951/pg59951-images.html)) changed direction in the Arabian peninsula.  Maybe they found a map of Arabia, saw "Nahum", and estimated the north latitude?  Or maybe Joseph received a celestial clue?   Regardless, authors normally do not carefully study content they created for additional insights regarding the intent and minutiae of the content. 

This pair (Joseph and Frederick) also concluded that the family landed on a western shore at about 30 degrees south latitude in the Americas.  After reviewing the maps, they believed that the arrival must have been near Valparaíso, Chile.  From this, Frederick studied trade winds and developed a 14,000 mile voyage in the Southern Pacific (maybe plunging as far as 20 degrees south and catching a trade wind; he was likely not even aware of the existence of Antarctica at the time) to explain this arrival.  What "clue" gave them the 30 degrees south latitude possibility?  Did Joseph receive insight that the arrival was in South America, so reviewing the map they see a word that looks like paradise so conclude 'this is the place'?  Or was the clue more specific from the celestial?  "The family arrived on a western shore at about 30 degrees south latitude in the Americas."  If true, the source would likely be from the celestial similar to the Ancient American Record.  Apparently, the clue was given without a direct answer.  Nor was a verification given that the Valparaíso solution was correct.  Seemingly, the celestial concluded the clue was sufficient, if one carefully studied it in appropriate context.  

A careful study of Isaiah's prophecy (that the family was going 'to river islands', hence the spiritual name Lehi [לָאִיִּ] which is found in this prophecy [42:15]) would suggest that there are a few potential "western shores" along a river at 30 degrees south latitude within South America:  Paraná/Corriente, Uruguay, (Salado), Ibicuí or possibly even one (Tramandaí) on the eastern shoreline (Atlantic coast).  A few options that may be considered a river island (Imbé on Tramandaí and two potential sites near Esquina on Paraná/Corriente) at exactly 30 degrees south!  And the total distance required for travel may have been 8000 miles or less; for example, exploring the Moroni River on the Comoros island (CUM-OR-YAH: rising light of Jehovah), hugging the African coast with possible stops, crossing the South Atlantic (possibly stopping for water in the Gough islands), and approaching the Brasilian coastline before  entering the "great division/opening that Jehovah provided" (Para - ana).

##### Learning Hebrew, NOT learning Egyptian 
One can review the efforts of Joseph Smith to learn ancient languages.  For example, in the fall of 1835 (when Halley's Comet appeared), a winter course in Hebrew was offered in Kirtland, organized by Joseph Smith and others.  A very technical textbook was purchased, but arrangements for an accompanying instructor fell apart.  Joseph tried to use "spiritual revelatory power" to teach the course, which most of the forty students enrolled in the course considered a miserable failure.  Finally, a new instructor was found (Joshua Seixas, two years younger than Joseph).  Joshua was paid $320 to teach the course over two months in early 1836: two daily one-hour sessions (2 hours x 5-6 days x 8 weeks) which would equate to $4 per day to teach the course.  Certificates were presented to two of the forty students: an acumen certificate to Orson Pratt who excelled in the course and seemingly a "participation" certificate for the Prophet.

Before Joshua Seixas arrived on the scene, as Joseph attempted to guide the course of study, a tense debate arose between Orson and Joseph about the correct way to pronounce a letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  Both parties later claimed that they won the argument.  Orson was anchored to knowledge of his era; Joseph made a counter-argument based on his spiritual experiences associated with the translation process.  Very intriguing that the debate was about the pronounciation of a Hebrew language artifact.  This debate may support the idea that Joseph heard the language from his celestial source(s).

Simultaneously (July 1835), Joseph Smith acquired an Egyptian papyri which he claimed was associated with the Book of Abraham.  Using "pure revelation", he translated the text within a few months while concurrently studying Hebrew.  In a global context, the Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799 and the two competing scholars developed some initial frameworks for translation in about 1823; Young died in 1829 and Champollion died in 1832.

#### Summary of Mixture Hypothesis 
Synthesizing the main themes above, one can conclude:  (1) Joseph would study the Book of Mormon content as if it was not his creation (if you invented the story, would you get out a map to find the associated location geographically); (2) Joseph would seem to get clarification clues, at least some were specifically phonetic clues, as he studied 'out of the best books.'; (3) Joseph Smith was learning Hebrew 5 years after the publication of the Book of Mormon and had mediocre acumen in the Introduction to Biblical Hebrew course at that time; (4) Joseph Smith was confident that the Book of Abraham could be easily translated from Ancient Egyptian using only the spiritual in an era where few people on earth had any understanding of Ancient Egyptian at the time almost, as if, he already had some source text; (5) Joseph Smith would leverage his unique language acumen to translate the book of Genesis transforming "this is my work to my glory to the immortality to the eternal life of man" into what later gets cannonized as Moses 1:39; (6) the confluence of Egyptian/Hebrew acumen adds to novel content generated by Joseph Smith, appropriately labeled "A Pearl of Great Price".  


### Concise proof:  And my father dwelt in a tent.
A proof is sufficient evidence to support a proposition.  In context of this thesis, what is sufficient evidence to support that proposition that Joseph Smith had some Ancient Americian Record that he "translated" from the Eyptian/Hebrew to English?  Circumstantial evidence was described above, now a concrete example will be explored.

The most obvious phrase to demonstrate this proof is:  "And my father dwelt in a tent."  First, this phrase exists.  Second, Sidney would have no reason whatsoever to editorialize this phrase.  Third, it visually displays the context of what is also vocalized.  Fourth, it is both a visual and vocal palindrome.  Fifth, although the language used is very simple, its implications are indeed profound.

I estimate that the statement is surrounded in "lamads" like we would surround a dictation with appropriate quotation marks to mean "a teaching".  Notice, it does NOT say "And it came to pass" in this instance.  Without the lamads, the phrase would be:  "v ab-y sh y-ba-v".  With the lamads: "l-v-ab-y sh y-ba-v-l".  The [sh] may be a compound making the phrase 10 or 12 symbols; if a single [sh], the phrase would be 9 or 11 symbols.  I estimate the [sh] (breasts) in "l-v-ab-y sh y-ba-v-l" represents the center of the family living, the warmth of the gathering:  warm milk for the little ones, and warm comfort between mother and father.  The symbols described how family life existed, what some modern readers may call a nomadic living arrangment.  

#### Left side, strong side 
On the left side is a pillar of protection, followed by a cow and a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The left side is the feminine.  The place for mother and children to take care of feminine activities:  within a region defined as safe (contained within the boundary marker of the pillar), milk the female cow, prepare kefir/cheese/butter, gather the eggs from female birds, kill/prepare the smaller animals to eat such as female birds, and bake breads that rise.  

#### Right side, stronger side 
The right side is symmetric:  a pillar of protection (as a border), a cow [likely male], a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The right side is the masculine.  The place for father and pubescent sons to take care of the masculine activities:  protect the borders, watch the herds, slaughter the cow/goat/lamb and cook the meat of larger animals, bake unleaven bread, do the man's work.  

The union of these separate activities is the [sh] in the middle, that represents the breasts of a woman.  She uses the breasts to merge the activities of the feminine and masculine into a cohesive familial society.  The breast literally nourishes the children (left side).  The breast literally comforts/entices and brings a fire to the parental congress (right side).  

#### Temple iconography
This parallel masculine/feminine structure can be seen in the design within the temple of Jehovah that Solomon builded.  As one enters the temple from the east approaching the Holy of Holies to the west:  5 menorah with the feminine date palm on the left (south as pure light); 5 menorah with the masculine date palm on the right (north as light and shadow); and to the west, the Holy of Holies that represents the great light of Jehovah (Ur-or-yah): 5 + 5 + 1 = 11.  Was this the narrative of Nephi regarding the sun and stars: 1 sun and 10 stars?  The Ark of the Covenant was guarded by two cherub:  a female cherub (cow with wings) on the left with the wing touching the male cherub (bull with wings) on the right to cover Ark.  The Ark had a top that served as a seat.  One smaller female cherub on the left with the right wing fold, the left wing opened to form a back for the seat, touching the symmetric smaller male cherub on the right.  Said Ark was a seat where two could sit: likely the female on the left (Asherah / Ishtar / Isis) and the male on the right (El / Jehovah / Osiris).  Likely facing east to receive the incoming guests, so the masculine would be on the north side of the seat (light and shadow), and the feminine would be on the south side of the seat(pure light).

#### Instructional Content 
With one phrase, Nephi could educate his children how a society best operates.  This is the true form of Abrahamic living that has been historically miscontrued as something altogether different.  It is an exogamic society where the daughters stay in the village where they were raised and the boys move to join another village and marry females that are not milk-sisters.  Interdependence of the genders.  Maybe Nephi learned this form of living while traveling among the children of Abraham's firstborn Ishmael in Arabia.  Maybe Nephi learned this from reading the brass plates.  Or maybe this was a common teaching from the MISNE that Nephi learned in his youth in the temple.

#### Academic "exactness"
Students of biblical Hebrew will object to the 'inexactness' of the above translation process based on the belief that their current understanding of Hebrew is the benchmark forgetting that biblical Hebrew is a broken language.  Using biblical Hebrew (stitching the elements of [Gen 13:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/13/18/s_13018), [Gen 19:34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/19/34/s_19034), [Num 19:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/num/19/14/s_136014))), the symbols would be (from left-to-right):  


![Biblical: And my father dwelt in a tent](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/biblical-tent-a.png?raw=true) *And my father dwelt in a tent*

//-->

The variants comparing "a tent" versus "the tent" comprise two different symbol options for "h" (and interestingly may form 'halal' the opposite of 'haram').  In total, the symbols between my hypothesized "translation" and the Biblical Hebrew mapped to Early Paleo-Hebrew are very similar.  Even if you dismiss my proposal that the symbolism was a palindrome, the overall ability to use the symbols without sound to understand the intended meaning are evident: enclosures for animals, hands to perform activities, enclosures for humans, breasts to perform their activities, a staff for herding animals and to represent teaching (or maybe one staff for herding and one set of folded clothes for making fabrics), a pillar for protecting the family society and to represent ruling.

#### Translation or Composition?
Where did this statement come from?  Well, from Joseph Smith which he claims represented a translation of an Ancient American Record. An alternative explanation (genius) would be:  Joseph Smith learned Hebrew before the Nauvoo era, was able to understand the underlying Early Paleo-Hebrew symbols (which were not discovered in the modern era until 1870), and intentionally wrote this simple phrase.  Or (random): Joseph would open the Bible and just randomly pick correlated words to develop a phrase that exists as a mixture of Biblical Hebrew.  Or (lucky):  Joseph made up some English words within the Nephi narrative that just happen to have correlations to an ancient form of living.  Or (translation): Joseph received a text from some spiritual source and voiced it.  And someone wrote it down.  And it passed the Sidney filter. And it made it into the published Book of Mormon.

#### Translation Implication
I need to emphasize: the language of Nephi is NOT a broken language.  And maybe the palindrome hypothesis is correct.  Maybe not. Or maybe a nonlinear circular form of the symbols could be developed as a hypothesis.  Regardless, the proof remains.  And my father dwelt in a tent.  A phrase that Clemens would identify as overally simple.  No literary significance to the composition in the English language.  Yet, this phrase had significance for its content and composition in Early Paleo-Hebrew:  females live in one bayit (tent/house) with the children, males live in another bayit (tent/house), and the breasts unite the two into a family society.  

And therein is a significant implication.  Nephi's language can help restore the broken Hebrew and the lost Egyptian.  It is like a Rosetta stone, but so much more.  As Joseph Smith described:  it is the keystone of religion.  Not just Judeo-Christian religion, nor Abrahamic religion.  It is the keystone of all religion.  Religion means to "bind again" and the language and teachings of Nephi will empower us with the knowledge to be "bound again" to our celestial heritage.  Many may describe such a claim as esoteric, and it may be so.  Joseph Smith was an innovator born in a traditional Christian era, and the innovations he received got pigeon-holed into the Christian frame yet a universal religion may have been part of his ambition and effort.

What other significant teachings are still embedded in the editorialized Legend of Nephi?  What teachings would be included?  First, it does seem like Nephi would downplay the life and luxury of the society of Jerusalem.  Second, Nephi would have significant new knowledge as his family interacted with the descendants of Abraham's first-born Ishmael BEFORE the Muhammed reformations.  Third, Nephi would have significant new knowledge about ships, trade, and economics when arriving in the southern region of Arabia and preparing to build one or more ships and embark on trans-oceanic travel.  Fourth, Nephi does not write (or formally finish) the Legend until AFTER living in the Americas for over two decades.  Consider how many different peoples and societies Nephi may have observed in the development and engineering of an ideal united society.  And consider what is NOT included in the primary teachings.  The primary message is "be industrious" but the details of metallurgy, pottery, agrarian technologies, basket-weaving, papyrus-making, ship building, earth-moving, and so on are NOT included.

#### Summary of Proof 
A mathematician likes to ponder the essence of a problem and its many facets.  And then, a mathematician will present a proof in a minimal form.  I could use other examples, but this one example, is sufficient.  The phrase "And my father dwelt in a tent" exists within the Book of Mormon, was not copied from the Bible, and within Early Paleo-Hebrew (Egyptian language in the learning of the Jews not discovered until 1870) has pictoral meanings consistent with the English rendition of the phrase, which demonstrates a fundamental teaching about a form of ancient living that may in fact be a palindrome which would update the broken form of Biblical Hebrew.

For some, this example is not enough.  It doesn't prove anything!  To such critics, my reply is simple.  "There are 10 types of people in this world.  Those that understand mathematics.  And those that do not."  For those in the know, a finite-state machine needs a snapshot of a system, a seed if you will.  Once iterated and updated, in the limit, the outcome of stationarity will be achieved.

Interestingly, Nephi also offers a similar minimal proof using Isaiah to demonstrate that the man to be born in the flesh as the Messiah was a seraph on the right hand of God in the celestial.  The flaming fiery serpent, a descendent of Ahaz was likely the same seraph that placed a fiery coal on Isaiah's tongue when Isaiah was called.  The Messiah was the Son of God, a simple proof Nephi points out in his educational "plain and precious" teachings for his children.
