### Proof the underlying text is an Ancient American Record 

When you discuss 'burden of proof', where does the burden fall?  An apologist gets trapped into attempts on defending every anachronism or inconsistency.  This is the fatal flaw of the apologist.  The antagonists try to frame the argument illogically, not being well versed in the logical fallacy Karl Popper defined as the falsification principle, aka the "Black Swan" problem.  Just because you have never seen a black swan, that does not mean they don't exist. Apologists like to coin this logical frame as "a lack of evidence is not evidence of lack".   The falsification principle defines where the burden of proof lies.  Antagonists try to switch the frame using anachronistic arguments about horses or steel or (insert anachronism here).

The Book of Mormon as a thing exists.  If you want to take an antagonist view, you have to demonstrate where and how it came about.  Joseph Smith offered one explanation, the burden of proof is to offer a counter-explanation.  Any serious student will dismiss the Solomon Spaulding or Captain Kidd or View of Hebrews (or even Last of the Mohicans - another literary work Mark Twain despised).  Computational linguistics (using latent semantic analysis, cosine similarity for document correlations) is one area of personal expertise, and nothing significant in this literary comparison has merit.

Hebrew poetic forms like chaismic structure seems to be available for consideration.  Most notable are the King Benjamin speech and Alma 36.  How can one explain how such poetry was crafted?  And that it was only used at certain times and places?  Within context of the internal narrative, the change-point to introduced chiasmic poetry is consistent.  The people of Nephi spoke the Egyptian language and had the learning of the Jews.  The people of Mulek were nobles and likely were educated in many languages:  Egyptian, Hebrew, Assyrian, and Babylonian.  However, they did not have any written records with them so relied on oral traditions.  About 400 years later, these two societies collided.  And the Hebrew oral traditions were likely used as memory devices.  Now, when these two societies merge into one, there will be knowledge spillover and adoption.  The people of Nephi have written records, superior weaponry and a superior economic system.  So naturally, they become the rulers although the kingmen don't fully agree as will be demonstrated within a few years.  With all of that being said, King Benjamin used chiasmic structure in his famous speech: likely as a sign of good will to connect the two traditions.  Maybe chiasmic structure existed before among the people of Nephi, but with the data we have, it seems to be the joining of the people of Mulek with the people of Nephi was indeed a change point.  

And after the merger, Mormon made it very clear that language further evolved (devolved) into something that would not be understood by the ancients.  Interestingly, when Mormon discovers the small plates, it seems as if he is able to easily able to understand the ancient language.  Was Mormon able to read the narrative of Lehi so easily as well?  Of note, is the change-point for Mormon personally upon discovered these small plates with the first leaf being darkened.  No longer does he declare "I am a descendant of Lehi" (3 Nephi); now he declares "I am a descendant of Nephi" (Words of Mormon).  Something therein Nephi wrote clarified to Mormon his genealogy.  But where and what?  

Mormon also wrote to his son Moroni a letter, sharing with his son that he (Mormon) finally figured out what his name meant.  Before, he described himself as Mormon, the son of Mormon, named after the Waters of Mormon (the story of Alma).  Now he writes to his son the meaning of his name.  And Joseph Smith shared this meaning later to those around him:  God's love or good love.  Imagine the debate that must have followed:  'Mormon is the name of the author of the book, it does not mean God's love Joseph.  Charity means God's love!'

So, Sidney Rigdon, steeped in the Pauline epistles and traditional wisdom took it upon himself to expand the original terse letter between a father and son, pontificated that "Charity is the pure love of Christ" is a classic Sidney introjection, an entire sermon it would seem.  The simplicity of the original authentic dialogue is what I want to read.  One day.

Taken altogether, I have included the stem [mor-mon-ya] in my estimation of the first phrase written by Nephi in his small plates, the legend of Nephi.  This certainly would capture Mormon's attention.  And it is a reference to Egyptian mythology that we (humans) are descended from the celestial (the gods) who came on a vessel (boat or ship) from a sacred water (lake).  A much different view of our origins than a modern Judeo-Christian norm.

Certainly Joseph Smith was engaged in expanding such views:  [elohim] as a plurality of gods, eternal progression to become a god, and the glory of god being the experience and learning obtained in this life.  Very far removed from a monotheistic view that evolved (or devolved) following the Messiah Death Event; of which, the Masoretes were intentional in removing the notion of polytheism in their efforts to preserve their legacy and remain relevant.

Interesting, there are many "poly" innovations that Joseph Smith suggested:  polytheism, polygenesis, polyamory to name the big 3.  If Nephi had ingrained these concepts in his worldview and writings, where they blatantly removed by the intellectualism of Sidney?

#### Concise proof:  And my father dwelt in a tent.
This is the best phrase I can use as a concise proof.  First, Sidney would have no reason whatsoever to editorialize this phrase.  Second, it visually displays the context of what is also vocalized.  Third, it is both a visual and vocal palindrome.  Fourth, its implications are profound.

I estimate that the statement is surrounded in "lamads" like we would surround a dictation with appropriate quotation marks.  Notice, it does NOT say "And it came to pass" in this instance.  Without the lamads, the phrase would be:  "v-ab-ee sh ee-ab-v".  With the lamads: "l-v-ab-ee sh ee-ab-v-l".  The [sh] may be a compound making the phrase 10 or 12 symbols; if a single [sh], the phrase would be 9 or 11 symbols.  The symbols described how family life existed, what some modern readers may call a nomadic living arrangment.  On the left side is a pillar of protection, followed by a cow and a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The left side is the feminine.  The place for mother and children to take care of feminine activities:  milk the female cow, gather the female eggs from birds, kill/prepare the smaller animals to eat such as birds, and bake breads that rise.  The right side is symmetric:  a pillar of protection, a cow [likely male], a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The right side is the masculine.  The place for father and pubescent sons to take care of the masculine activities:  protect the borders, slaughter the cow and cook the meat of larger animals, do the man's work.  The union of these separate activities is the [sh] in the middle, that represents the breasts of a woman.  She uses the breasts to merge the activities of the feminine and masculine into a cohesive society.  The breast nourishes the children and comforts/entices the father in marital congress.  This parallel can be seen in the building structure on the temple grounds of Jehovah that Solomon builded:  5 menorah with the feminine date palm on the left; 5 menorah with the masculine date palm on the right; and in the holy of holies a female cherub (cow with wings) on the left with the wing touching the male cherub (bull with wings) on the right to cover the Ark of the Covenant in the middle.  Said Ark was a seat where two could sit: likely the female on the left (Asherah / Ishtar / Isis) and the male on the right (El / Jehovah / Osiris).  

With one phrase, Nephi could educate his children how a society best operates.  This is the true form of harem living that has been historically miscontrued as something altogether different.  It is an exogamic society where the daughters stay in the village where they were raised and the boys move to join another village and marry females that are not milk-sisters.  Interdependence of the genders.

Students of biblical Hebrew will object to the inexactness of the translation process based on the belief that their current understanding of Hebrew is the benchmark forgetting that biblical Hebrew is a broken language.  I need to emphasize: the language of Nephi is NOT a broken language.  And therein is a significant implication.  Nephi's language can help restore the broken Hebrew and the lost Egyptian.  It is like a Rosetta stone, but so much more.  As Joseph Smith described:  it is the keystone of religion.  Not just Judeo-Christian religion, nor Abrahamic religion.  It is the keystone of all religion.  Religion means to "bind again" and the language and teachings of Nephi will enable us all bound again with our celestial heritage.  Many may describe such a claim as esoteric, and it may be so.  Joseph Smith was an innovator born in a traditional Christian era, and the innovations he received got pigeon-holed into that framework.  

#### Summary
A mathematician likes to examine the essence of a problem and then present a proof in a minimal form.  I could use other examples, but this one example, is sufficient.  Interestingly, this same minimal proof is used by Nephi as he utilizes Isaiah to prove that the man to be born in the flesh as the Messiah was in fact, on the right hand of God in the celestial before.  The flaming fiery serpent, a descendent of Ahaz was the same seraph that placed a fiery coal on Isaiah's tongue when Isaiah was called.  The Messiah was the Son of God, a simple proof Nephi points out in his educational "plain and precious" teachings for his children.

#### How
Many times a mathematician working on a proof does NOT reveal the minutiae that led to the distilled essence and result.  So, it can be difficult to under "how" one arrived at that conclusion.  For me, an independent study of the times and seasons associated with the birth and death of Yeshua in association to the numbers provided in the Book of Mormon was the key data that has put me on a path of rediscovery challenging my internal belief systems.  Once you conclude that institutions manage information for Ciceran purposes (grow and self-preserve), layering of belief needs to be deconstructed:  my Mormon traditions, the underlying Judeo-Christian traditions, and the underlying American-British-Roman traditions.  Nephi was wise when he observes how the "traditions of the fathers" can easily blind us.

The number 600 is the beginning.  With 12 as an embedded factor, this is a perfect number.  Some key ways of arriving at 600 are:  60 × 10; 75 x 8; 50 x 12.  Of note, is the Noah reference to the same number in his timeline.  Anchored to a Christian belief that Yeshua was born around year 0 (in a mathematician's dating system), 600 BC and 600 AD are important markers.  Maybe 600 AD is anchored to the wisdom of Muhammad before his hijra in 622.  Maybe Moses or Joseph or Abraham was born in the 600 year cycle.  Noah has a referential anchor to this number.  Maybe the great Buddha is an anchor as well, not limiting the cycle to the Abrahamic tradition.

The Chinese have a 600 year cycle based on the heaven stems (12) and the earth stems (10) which are decomposed of 5 elements and the duality of the yin-yang.  The symbol for the number 10 in Chinese is the same symbol as the original [tav] of Ancient Hebrew, the symbol of the cross.  The Roman Numeral was merely a rotation of [+] to form an [X].  One of the fundamental earth-stem elements is Water.  And this begins the relationship.  Every 60 years, 5 earth stems pass through 12 heaven stems where the heaven stems are today associated with an animal and an etiological story of a race describes the order.  The first animal is the Rat, followed by the Ox.  The Ox gave the Rat a ride for a large portion of the race and either the Rat deceived the Ox to win OR the Ox allowed the Rat to win (go first).  The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".

The Book of Mormon prophesy was precise, 600 years.  About a birth.  And what is missing from the 1 Nephi narrative is the anchor or associations to the stars.  As is the 2100 year prophecy associated with "Colon-mbia".  In my reflections, I consider that Nephi used omission (fill in the blank) as a teaching tool:  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  Why?  Well, if the Book of Lehi was slightly altered but the exact details of the alterations were not clear, it would be very difficult to piece those together:  all we have is a Egyptian marker with with the word "Sha-zer" which I classify as a Super Word in the ancient languages.  The two stems can tell an entire story, and this was a teaching device: a sacred grove of almond trees, early spring, snow or blossoms dropping like snow or both, a difficult birth in a garden with an umbilical complication, and so on.  This was the birth of Jacob!  So the 600 year prophecy was anchored to the birth of Jacob!  So as we try to create a consistent timeline, this is another data point.  We know when the city of Jerusalem was under siege, so sneaking around the walls of the city was not possible.  We have academic studies of when Yeshua was likely born.  Taking together, we have a system of equations that can be solved.  And so I have arrived in my studies that Yeshua was born 5 April of 8 BC, the year of the Water Ox which for whatever reason also is the year -600 in the Bengali calendar.  There were many signs in the heavens, not just one, as Samuel the Lamanite explained.  His 5-year prophecy tied to our current understanding of comet appearances in 12 BC and ~600 BC bring the data together.  The comet we attribute to Halley has been orbiting our solar system with an average 75 year cycle.  (Interestingly, Joseph Smith experienced this phenomenon in 1835 which was preceded by other signs in the heavens.)  This phenomenon was seen in the heavens when Nephi's brother Jacob was born and was used as a marker for events.  Eight cycles from Jacob's birth to Yeshua's birth.  Twenty more cycles before "Colon-mbia".  Said differently, anchored to 60, we could say ten big years (ten cycles of 60) from Jacob's birth until Yeshua's birth.  And twenty-five more big years until "Colon-mbia".  1492 + 8 = 1500.  Or before the thirty-fifth cycle since Shazer (see the numbers 33 and 34 in 3 Nephi).  The rise of Cahokia about 1066 and its decline after 1441.  The disappearance of many thriving civilizations throughout the Americas after 1441: many disappeared before the conquest following 1492 began.

So the various data all aligned very nicely with the exception of 3 Nephi.  Today, I believe the numbers 33 and 34 have very significant meaning, but in the day of Sidney Rigdon it was commonly believed that Yeshua was born 1 AD and died 34 AD living a perfect life of 33 years.  My calculations have Yeshua being born 5 April 8 BC and dying 5 May 31 AD, living 37 years, 30 days.  So I asked myself, was there motivation for the numbers to be fudged?  At the time, I believe any alterations would have been the work of Oliver Cowdery.  So I reviewed the manuscript data we have (thanks to the efforts of Royal Skousen).  We only have data from the printer's manuscript for 3 Nephi, but there is some evidence that numbers associated with the years were crossed-out and replaced.

Now, as I reflect on my journey, I have concluded that during the Joseph Smith era, everyone understood that Joseph as Prophet received novel content that was organized into the Book of Mormon with the help of his scribes.  And if you read the carefully crafted description of David Whitmer before his passing, it seems evident that oaths were made among the inner circle to not divulge certain details explicitly regarding the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon.

#### So what 
Being raised in the Mormon tradition, it was very difficult to challenge one's own internal belief system.  For me personally, the mathematics was undeniable.  But what are the consequences?  Again, I think about the consequences also in a maths frame.  What is the finite state of the system?  I experience cognitive dissonance, I realize my internal belief system is flawed.  So what do I do?  I could play the Dahlin card and spend the rest of my life feeding the flames of real feelings of perceived betrayal.  Where does that road lead?  What is the finite state of that choice?  Living an angry, bitter life.  No thank you.

So a mathematician will extend and abstract the consequences before settling on a finite state machine.  The Mormon Church institution manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  Once you get on that train, the conclusions are obvious:  The Christian institution formalized by Constantine and reformed ever since has manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  The Masoretic tradition of Jewish thought manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

If you distill these realities, the obvious conclusion is that the Messiah Death Event was very significant.  Why else would the Masoretes manipulate the original Passover tradition and invent the golden calf narrative which was non-existent in the Greek Septuagint?  Why would the polytheistic Roman society have a mother-son adopt such a minor religion if there was not data we do not current have to motivate such adoption?  Interestingly, the best source document we have to unlock the truth about the Messiah Death Event is the Book of Mormon, with all of its editorial editions and flaws.

Maybe Sidney was ignorant to the distinction, and I do not have any knowledge if the difference was openly discussed by the early Church: 3 days of darkness is NOT 3 hours of darkness.  Certainly Sidney would have known the traditional narrative, yet 3 Nephi expands the destruction.  Whether it was discussed and debated during the manuscript preparation is unknown, but what is known is that this data point survived the editorial process.  This was the anchor of faith from which Mormonism could have thrived to fulfill the promise of Isaiah:  that the knowledge of Jehovah would fill the world like the waters fill the sea.  Apologists seem to want to make this data point disappear rather than anchor and pivot from it.  If Roman tradition says there was 3 hours of darkness and Nephi tradition says there was 3 days of darkness, who should you believe?  An uninvolved witness half way around the world, or a society directly involved with the Messiah Death Event?  

Aha!  Can you see?

Why is it that Roman history is silent until about 100 AD where two historians are then commissioned to write narratives?  Josephus to write from a Jewish perspective and Pliny the Younger to write from a Roman perspective.  

And that, my dear reader, is the seed needed to move forward.  To reconstruct your understanding of the Messiah Death Event.  To enable you to understand the purpose of this planet [mor-mon-ya] and your celestial heritage.

Godspeed.  Namaste.
