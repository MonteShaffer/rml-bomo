## Proof the underlying text is an Ancient American Record 

When you discuss 'burden of proof', where does the burden fall?  The antagonists try to frame the argument illogically.  Either the antagonist is intentionally being obtuse or the antagonist is ignorant to the falsification principle (aka the "Black Swan" problem):  Just because you have never seen a black swan, that does not mean they don't exist.  Scholars in academia do not like this logic frame as it challenges most of their conclusions; most especially among social scientists.  Karl Popper pointed this logical fallacy out to the research community in the 1970s and many published research articles still violate this fundamental principle.   

In context of the Book of Mormon, antagonists try to switch the frame using anachronistic arguments about horses or steel or (insert anachronism here).  An apologist gets trapped into attempts on defending every anachronism or inconsistency.  This is the fatal flaw of the apologist.  

The Book of Mormon as a thing exists.  The Black Swan exists!  Maybe it is full of blemishes, yet it exists.  As an antagonist, the burden is to demonstrate how this exists.  As Joseph Smith offered one explanation, the burden of proof is to offer a counter-explanation.  If Joseph was a master magician that has not revealed his secrets, the antagonist must "pull back the curtain" and expose him as a charlatan.

### Context of 1800s America 
Certainly, many contemporaries were trying to explain the unexplanable: over 200,000 earth mounds of varying sizes littered the lands from the Ohio River valley to upstate New York.  Thomas Jefferson carefully excavated a portion of one earthwork found on his property and concluded it was a burial mound that contained about 1000 souls.  Grave robbers would at times find valuable artifacts with a cadaver within a mound.  Any treasure find would spread rapidly, and the failures would be forgotten.  And likely, an industry of gold-diggers would emerge.  'There are thousands of options, where should we dig?  Maybe the Spanish later buried treasure in these earth works.  But which one?'  And if you failed at finding treasure in one dig, a simple excuse would be that the spirits protecting the treasure moved it.  This society of treasure hunters were a very different class of citizenry than, for example, Thomas Jefferson.  Rationalism and careful science was NOT driving the worldview of those seeking wealth by digging a hole.  Yet, everyone was trying to make sense of what existed: (1) why there were so many of these earthworks; (2) how were they constructed;  (3) 'since it is obvious these "dumb Indians" were incapable of such marvels', another group must have built them, but who; (4) who then are these "Indians": are they savages or noble? 

That we have lots of literary attempts to explain these realities is not surprising.  The quality of such efforts varied significantly.  Although Mark Twain would disagree, the "Last of the Mohicans" published in 1826, was an example of a quality literary effort.  Much better than, for example, "View of the Hebrews".   Regardless, a plagiarism challenge for the Book of Mormon is likely the weakest of arguments from an antagonist.  Any serious student will dismiss the Solomon Spaulding or Captain Kidd or View of Hebrews (or even Last of the Mohicans).  Computational linguistics (using latent semantic analysis, cosine similarity for document correlations) is one area of personal expertise, and nothing significant in this literary comparison has merit.  If Sidney augmented the narrative and gave permission for his authorship to remain anonymous, even the "editorialization thesis" would not be considered plagiarism.



### Joseph Smith authorship
So the antagonists must conclude that Joseph Smith invented the content as an author possibly sprinkling in ideas from the era in which he lived.  Without any attempt to refute the "Ancient American Record" dimension, the conclusion is merely "Joseph authored this, he did NOT translate anything."  Where is the proof of this conclusion?  In fact, if one carefully considers the logical frame of falsification, antagonists have no argument (they are declaring the "Black Swan" does not exist).  Even if Joseph Smith invented the entire narrative, where did these ideas come from?  Information-processing theory can propose various internal source mechanics, but the foundation of anything innovative from an individual is that it is idiosyncratic.  That is, how Joseph received the innovative content would be unique to him.  Maybe it was "all in his head" which he perceived to be a "translation process from a spiritual domain" but the fact remains:  the Book of Mormon exists.  

Consider, for example, the creation narrative "Extracts from Adam's Diary" written by Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain). The narrative exists and seems to have contextual correlation to the classic Judeo-Christian Genesis story.  Did Clemens 'plagiarize' the Bible?  Of course not!  However, the content of his narrative demonstrates his knowledge of biblical traditions.  Therefore, based on the nature of the author (an intellectual), we conclude this text is a parody full of humor and irony.  These are all interpretations we impose on the text.  And if we were to ask the author the intent, he would likely agree.  So where did the ideas and words come from?  From the author's mind of course.  How?  And, as they say, "Ay, there's the rub!"  It is unknowable how the mind of an author actually develops creative content.  This specific author was hyper-intellectual, yet that does NOT help clarify how ideas are generated within a homo sapien.  It is unknowable.

Now, let's compare the men.  Joseph's opus, the Book of Mormon, was published when he was 25 years old.  Clemens' opus, Huck Finn, took 7 years to write with two bursts of creativity with significant silence between them, was a continuation of Tom Sawyer, and was published when he was over 40 years old (after visiting Utah and reading the Book of Mormon).  Joseph was not an intellectual like Samuel Clemens.  Joseph's upbringing was more spiritually anchored (folksy) where sharing visions/dreams was normative behavior.  Clemens' upbringing was in a home with a father who practiced the law; a home where rationality, pragmatism, and logic were likely the normative behavior.  Samuel had significant literary skill which Joseph lacked.  Yet, Joseph had innovative content that Samuel could never match.  Samuel's writings are always anchored to the familiar: the Genesis story, life on the Mississippi, the slavery phenomenon, and even a Yankee in King Arthur's Court.  That is, Samuel has to anchor to the concrete to use his literary skills and intellect.  His genius was in the reconfiguration of existing content often classified as a form of incremental innovation.  Joseph Smith has no such anchors for his "imaginative ancient history" (as later described by Clemens) which would be classified as a form of radical innovation.  And likely, this is why the Book of Mormon annoys so many antagonists.  It is an anomaly.  An outlier.  How could so many unique/distinct ideas be thrown together into one text?  This baffles them.  

### Antagonist's Dilemna
So antagonists get trapped into a dilemna.  Do they anchor to Mark Twain's conclusion that the literary essence of the Book of Mormon is "chloroform in print"?  Or was Joseph Smith a genius in his ability to embed chiasmic poetry?    
#### Chiasmus
Chiasmus is a Hebraic poetic form.  And may serve as evidence of an Ancient American Record that was translated.  The best two examples of such structure is the King Benjamin speech (see Mosiah 2-5) and Alma's letter to his faithful son Helaman (Alma 36).  That does NOT mean these chiasmic structures did not face editorialization; very likely they did.  But was the chiasmic structure evidence of ancient literature or genius editors?  Maybe Joseph Smith or Oliver Cowdery or Sidney Rigdon had access to a book at a local library that defined chiastic structures.  Maybe.  But that doesn't enable them to be able to create chiasmic forms.  I can read the Sonnets of Shakespeare and understand the formation critera of pentameter and versification, that does not make it possible for me to create a good sonnet that is consistently themed.

Chiasmus and its use was internally consistent within the complex storyline of many distinct peoples.  In fact, an important introduction to chiasmus occurs at a significant internal change point.  The people of Nephi spoke the Egyptian language and had the learning of the Hebrews (e.g., PUCARA, not PETRA).  The people of Mulek were nobles and likely were educated in many languages:  Egyptian, Hebrew, Assyrian, and Babylonian with Hebrew being the primary language.  However, this group did not have any written records with them so relied on oral traditions, likely Hebrew traditions (e.g., PISGAH, not MIGDAL) to preserve cultural memory.  Over 300 years later, these two societies collided.  Now, when these two societies merge into one, there will be knowledge spillover and adoption.  The people of Nephi have written records, superior weaponry and a superior economic system.  So naturally, they become the rulers following the merger.  The people of Mulek were from the house of Judah who historically carries the scepter.  As such, although initially yielding, many of the house of Judah had no interest of being ruled by the teaching-class from the house of Joseph.  The kingmen rebellion will demonstrate this cultural-heritage conflict.    With all of that being said, King Benjamin used chiasmic structure in his famous speech: likely as a sign of good will to connect the two traditions.  Maybe chiasmic structure existed before among the people of Nephi (e.g., the Book of Lehi), but with the data we have, it seems to be the joining of the people of Mulek with the people of Nephi was indeed a change point.  That is, the internal record has no chiasmus, the peoples merge, and now chiasmus appears with the literary style being most prominent immediately following the merger.  Maybe a linguistic Eureka moment for the people of Nephi reminding them of their poetic heritage.

#### Chloroform
Mark Twain visited Utah in the 1860s, bought a Book of Mormon, devoured it, and concluded that it was "chloroform in print."  At the time, chloroform was just being developed for commercialization as a inhalant anesthesia: Twain's comment demonstrates his intellect and wit.  That is, the book would put you to sleep.  Repetitive and pretentious.  A confluence (Twain labels a mongrel) of an imaginary history weaved into Biblical norms.  The ancient [imaginary history] is constrained and confused:  is it intended to be simple or have gravitas?  

This critique is fascinating and insightful demonstrating both the intellectual capabilities of the critic as well as his literary prowess.  However, to me, the criticism further supports the idea that the Book of Mormon was a Gaussian mixture of two distinct elements: something ancient (described as imaginary by Twain) and something contemporary that was glib, pontificated, verbose, repetitive, and pretentious.  

### Mixture-module Hypothesis
Mark Twain was brilliant, concise, and thorough in his book review.  And his conclusions align with the premise of this treatise to explain the Book of Mormon origins:  there was a source that got editorialized as a manuscript was created. What Mark Twain describes as an imaginary ancient history developed by the author, the author describes as being received through spiritual means.  Those views are not competing; they are, in fact, directionally consistent.  Since human perception is idiosyncratic, what Twain understood to be author's imaginations was considered spiritual guidance by Joseph.  Potato, Tomato!  And as we will discover with the proof below, Mark Twain saw something ancient that he considered imagination that was undeveloped from a literary perspective, but its simplicity was inherent to the text being translated not composed.

#### Joseph Smith, after the publication 
Joseph Smith's behavior, after the publication, is an important marker in trying to discern the source.  Joseph was both ignorant and brilliant:  he would voice new ideas that amazed and inspired yet did not know the city of Jerusalem was surrounded by walls.    In a safe environment, surrounded by a man he admired for his intellect and trusted completely (Frederick Granger Williams), Joseph would engage in gospel-study sessions.  One study topic was related to geography; Frederick was a former barge captain so understood a little about ships and maps.  So together they would read excerpts of the Book of Mormon, open contemporary maps, and would try to understand the movements of Nephi early in the story.  That is, they were reading it as source material NOT as something Joseph himself invented!

For example, they concluded at about 19 degrees north latitude, the family changed direction in the Arabian peninsula.  Maybe they found a map of Arabia, saw the "Nahum" marker, and estimated the north latitude?  Or maybe Joseph received a celestial clue?   Regardless, authors normally do not carefully study content they created for additional insights regarding the intent and minutiae of the content. 

This pair (Joseph and Frederick) also concluded that the family landed on a western shore at about 30 degrees south latitude in the Americas.  After reviewing the maps, they believed that the arrival must have been near Valparaíso, Chile.  From this, Frederick studied trade winds and developed a 14,000 mile voyage in the Southern Pacific to explain this arrival (likely not even being aware of Antartica at the time).  What "clue" gave them the 30 degrees south latitude possibility?  Did Joseph receive insight that the arrival was in South America, so reviewing the map they see a word that looks like paradise?  Or was the clue more specific from the celestial?  "The family arrived on a western shore at about 30 degrees south latitude in the Americas."  If true, the source material would be likely similar to the Ancient American Record.  Apparently, the clue was given but a direct answer was not given.  Nor was a verification given that the Valparaíso conclusion was correct.  Seemingly, the celestial believe the clue was sufficient, if one carefully studied it in appropriate context.  A careful study of Isaiah's prophecy (that the family was going to river islands, hence the spiritual name Lehi [לָאִיִּ] which is found in this prophecy [42:15]) would suggest that there are a few potential "western shores" along a river at 30 degrees south latitude:  Paraná, Uruguay, (Salado), Ibicuí.  At least one potential arrival point has a river island! And the total distance required for travel may have been 8000 miles or less.

  
#### Mormon origins 
Mormon wrote a letter to his son Moroni a sharing that he (Mormon) finally figured out what his name (Mormon) meant.  Before this letter, the father described himself as Mormon, the son of Mormon, named after the Waters of Mormon (the story of Alma).  Now, he writes to his son the meaning of his name.  What changed?  Mormon discovered and read the small plates of Nephi.  Not included in the publication of the Book of Mormon, but shared by Joseph Smith to many devotees, Mormon means the good love or God's love.  Seemingly the debate during the editorialization process may have gone like this:  'Mormon is the name of the author of the book, it does not mean God's love Joseph.  Charity means God's love!'

So it would seem, Joseph relented.  And Sidney Rigdon, steeped in the Pauline epistles and traditional wisdom, took it upon himself to expand the original terse letter between a father and son: "dear son, I figured out that my name Mormon means God's love or the good love.  love, dad".  A classic Sidney introjection, demonstrating his acumen with Pauline philosophy expands the letter:  "Charity is the pure love of Christ..."  What Sidney considered Christian clever may be the essence of what Clemens considered self-aggrandizing, 'modern' glib, repetitive of the New Testament.

The simplicity of the original authentic dialogue is what I want to read.  One day.  And I imagine the gravitas that is currently lacking will be significant and profound.  Once the "editorialization" layer is removed.  

#### Mormon's genealogy and language 

Another significant change point for Mormon was an understanding of his genealogy.  Before, he proudly declares "I am a descendant of Lehi" (3 Nephi).  Then, following the Mosiah-priority of the translation order, he discovers the small plates.  Now, he declares "I am a descendant of Nephi" (Words of Mormon).  So what did Mormon read to inform this change?  Something clarified the exact genealogy, but what was it?  Where did it go?  Why would it be editorialized?  Nephi already had lied, deceived, stoled, and killed, what would be the harm of revealing he also lived a polyamorous life, taking one of Sam's daughters to wife?

Mormon also made it very clear that language  was constantly evolving (devolving).  Mormon, living about 600 years after the people of Nephi (Egyptian language) merged with the people of Mulek (Hebrew language), concluded that the current language form would not be understood by the ancient groups.  Yet interestingly, when Mormon discovers the small plates, it seems as if he is easily able to understand the most ancient form of the language.  Was Mormon able to read the narrative of Lehi so easily as well?  Or would it be like reading Beowulf in the old English?

#### Joseph Smith's esoteric perspective  

Taken altogether, I have included the stem [mor-mon-ya] in my estimation of the first phrase written by Nephi in his small plates, the legend of Nephi.  This specific inclusion certainly would have captured Mormon's attention.  And it is a reference to Egyptian mythology that we (humans) are descended from the celestial (the gods) who came on one or more vessels (boats or ships) from a sacred pure water (lake) in the highlands.  A much different view of our origins than a modern Judeo-Christian norm.

Certainly Joseph Smith was engaged in expanding Judeo-Christian views of his era:  [elohim] as a plurality of gods, eternal progression to become a god, and the glory of god being the experience and learning obtained in this life.  Very far removed from a monotheistic view that evolved (or devolved) following the Messiah Death Event; of which, the Masoretes were intentional in removing the notion of polytheism in their efforts to preserve their legacy and remain relevant.

Interesting, there are many "poly" innovations that Joseph Smith suggested:  polytheism, polygenesis, polyamory to name the big 3.  If Nephi had these concepts ingrained in his worldview and writings, were they blatantly removed by the intellectualism of Sidney replaced with the classic monotheistic, polygenesis, monogamous views of 1820s Christianity?

### Concise proof:  And my father dwelt in a tent.
This is the best phrase I can use as a concise proof that the Book of Mormon is derived from an Ancient American Record:  "And my father dwelt in a tent."  First, this phrase exists.  Second, Sidney would have no reason whatsoever to editorialize this phrase.  Third, it visually displays the context of what is also vocalized.  Fourth, it is both a visual and vocal palindrome.  Fifth, although the language used is very simple, its implications are indeed profound.

I estimate that the statement is surrounded in "lamads" like we would surround a dictation with appropriate quotation marks to mean "a teaching".  Notice, it does NOT say "And it came to pass" in this instance.  Without the lamads, the phrase would be:  "v ab-y sh y-ba-v".  With the lamads: "l-v-ab-y sh y-ba-v-l".  The [sh] may be a compound making the phrase 10 or 12 symbols; if a single [sh], the phrase would be 9 or 11 symbols.  I estimate the [sh] (breasts) in "l-v-ab-y sh y-ba-v-l" represents the center of the family living, the warmth of the gathering:  warm milk for the little ones, and warm comfort between mother and father.  The symbols described how family life existed, what some modern readers may call a nomadic living arrangment.  

On the left side is a pillar of protection, followed by a cow and a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The left side is the feminine.  The place for mother and children to take care of feminine activities:  within a region defined as safe (contained within the boundary marker of the pillar), milk the female cow, gather the eggs from female birds, kill/prepare the smaller animals to eat such as female birds, and bake breads that rise.  

The right side is symmetric:  a pillar of protection (as a border), a cow [likely male], a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The right side is the masculine.  The place for father and pubescent sons to take care of the masculine activities:  protect the borders, watch the herds, slaughter the cow/goat/lamb and cook the meat of larger animals, bake unleaven bread,  do the man's work.  

The union of these separate activities is the [sh] in the middle, that represents the breasts of a woman.  She uses the breasts to merge the activities of the feminine and masculine into a cohesive society.  The breast literally nourishes the children (left side).  The breast literally comforts/entices and brings a fire to the parental congress (right side).  

This parallel masculine/feminine structure can be seen in the design within the temple of Jehovah that Solomon builded:  5 menorah with the feminine date palm on the left; 5 menorah with the masculine date palm on the right; and in the holy of holies a female cherub (cow with wings) on the left with the wing touching the male cherub (bull with wings) on the right to cover the Ark of the Covenant in the middle: 5 + 5 + 1 = 11.  Said Ark was a seat where two could sit: likely the female on the left (Asherah / Ishtar / Isis) and the male on the right (El / Jehovah / Osiris).  

With one phrase, Nephi could educate his children how a society best operates.  This is the true form of harem living that has been historically miscontrued as something altogether different.  It is an exogamic society where the daughters stay in the village where they were raised and the boys move to join another village and marry females that are not milk-sisters.  Interdependence of the genders.

#### Academic "exactness"
Students of biblical Hebrew will object to the 'inexactness' of the above translation process based on the belief that their current understanding of Hebrew is the benchmark forgetting that biblical Hebrew is a broken language.  Using biblical Hebrew (stitching the elements of [Gen 13:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/13/18/s_13018), [Gen 19:34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/19/34/s_19034), [Num 19:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/num/19/14/s_136014))), the symbols would be (from left-to-right):  


![Biblical: And my father dwelt in a tent](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-bomo/blob/main/images/biblical-tent-a.png?raw=true) *And my father dwelt in a tent*

//-->

The variants comparing "a tent" versus "the tent" comprise two different symbol options for "h".  In total, the symbols between my hypothesized "translation" and the Biblical Hebrew mapped to Paleo-Hebrew are very similar.  Even if you dismiss my proposal that the symbolism was a palindrome, the overall ability to use the symbols without sound to understand the intended meaning are evident: enclosures for animals, hands to perform activities, enclosures for humans, breasts to perform their activities, a staff for herding animals and to represent teaching, a pillar for protecting the family society and to represent ruling.


I need to emphasize: the language of Nephi is NOT a broken language.  So maybe the palindrome hypothesis is correct, or maybe a nonlinear circular form of the symbols could be developed as a hypothesis.  Regardless, the proof remains.  And my father dwelt in a tent.  A phrase that Clemens would identify as overally simple was teaching an entire method of living:  females live in one bayit (tent/house) with the children, males live in another bayit (tent/house), and the breasts unite the two into a family society.  

Where did this statement come from?  Well, from Joseph Smith which he claims represented a translation of an Ancient American Record. An alternative explanation (genius) would be:  Joseph Smith learned Hebrew before the Nauvoo era, was able to understand the underlying paleo-Hebrew symbols, and intentionally wrote this simple phrase.  Or (random): Joseph would open the Bible and just randomly pick correlated words to develop a phrase that exists as a mixture of Biblical Hebrew.  Or  (translation): Joseph received a text from some spiritual source and voiced it.  And someone wrote it down.  And it passed the Sidney filter. And it made it into the published Book of Mormon.


And therein is a significant implication.  Nephi's language can help restore the broken Hebrew and the lost Egyptian.  It is like a Rosetta stone, but so much more.  As Joseph Smith described:  it is the keystone of religion.  Not just Judeo-Christian religion, nor Abrahamic religion.  It is the keystone of all religion.  Religion means to "bind again" and the language and teachings of Nephi will empower us with the knowledge to be "bound again" to our celestial heritage.  Many may describe such a claim as esoteric, and it may be so.  Joseph Smith was an innovator born in a traditional Christian era, and the innovations he received got pigeon-holed into the Christian frame yet a universal religion may have been part of his ambition and effort.

What other significant teachings are still embedded in the editorialized Legend of Nephi?  What teachings would be included?  First, it does seem like Nephi would downplay the life and luxury of the society of Jerusalem.  Second, Nephi would have significant new knowledge as his family interacted with the descendants of Abraham's first-born Ishmael BEFORE the Muhammed reformations.  Third, Nephi would have significant new knowledge about ships, trade, and economics when arriving in the southern region of Arabia and preparing to build one or more ships and embark on trans-oceanic travel.  Fourth, Nephi does not write the Legend until AFTER living in the Americas for over two decades.  Consider how many different peoples and societies Nephi may have observed in the development and engineering of an ideal united society.  And consider what is NOT included in the primary teachings.  The primary message is "be industrious" but the details of metallurgy, pottery, agrarian technologies, basket-weaving, papyrus-making, ship building, earth-moving, and so on are NOT included.


#### Summary of Proof 
A mathematician likes to examine the essence of a problem and then present a proof in a minimal form.  I could use other examples, but this one example, is sufficient.  Interestingly, Nephi also offers a similar minimal proof using Isaiah to demonstrate that the man to be born in the flesh as the Messiah was a seraph on the right hand of God in the celestial.  The flaming fiery serpent, a descendent of Ahaz was likely the same seraph that placed a fiery coal on Isaiah's tongue when Isaiah was called.  The Messiah was the Son of God, a simple proof Nephi points out in his educational "plain and precious" teachings for his children.

### Behind the mathematician's curtain 
Many times a mathematician working on a proof does NOT reveal the minutiae that led to the distilled essence and result.  So, it can be difficult to under "how" one arrived at that conclusion.  For me, an independent study of the times and seasons associated with the birth and death of the Messiah in association to the numbers provided in the Book of Mormon was the key data that has put me on a path of rediscovery challenging my internal belief systems; at the time, this could be tied directly to Oliver:  could Oliver have intentionally changed numbers to fit his belief system that would disrupt my calculations?  

#### Six-hundred year anchor
For me, the anchor point is the number 600.  The six hundred year prophecy between leaving Jerusalem and the birth of the Messiah.  And, this same number is found in the story of Noah.  And this number is associated with Muhammed (his wisdom received on his hijra was 622, so was he born in 592?).  And in my studies, there may be some connection to the Bengali calendar of the Gangan tradition.

The number 600 is the beginning with 6 being the first perfect number in mathematics.   Some key ways of arriving at 600 are:  60 × 10; 75 x 8; 50 x 12.  Of note, is the Noah reference to the same number in his timeline.  Anchored to a Christian belief that Yeshua was born around year 0 (in a mathematician's dating system), 600 BC and 600 AD are important markers.  Maybe 600 AD is anchored to the wisdom of Muhammad before his hijra in 622.  Maybe Moses or Joseph or Abraham was born in the 600 year cycle.  Noah has a referential anchor to this number.  Maybe the great Buddha is an anchor as well, not limiting the cycle to the Abrahamic tradition.

The Chinese have a 60 year cycle based on the heaven stems (12) and the earth stems (5) which are decomposed of 5 elements (五行 wuxing): Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood (and the duality of the yin-yang, so technically 120).  

The symbol for the number 10 in Chinese is the same symbol as the original [tav] of Ancient Hebrew, the symbol of the cross.  The Roman Numeral was merely a rotation of [+] to form an [X].  One of the fundamental earth-stem elements is Water.  And this begins the relationship.  

Every 60 years, 5 earth stems pass through 12 heaven stems where the heaven stems are today associated with an animal and an etiological story of a race describes the order of the 12 animals.  The first animal is the Rat, followed by the Ox.  The Ox gave the Rat a ride for a large portion of the race and either the Rat deceived the Ox to win OR the Ox allowed the Rat to win ('you go a head').  

The Book of Mormon prophesy as presented was precise, 600 years.  Certainly the Messianic birth is part of the prophecy.  What is the other anchor exactly?  Was it also a birth?  If so, who was born?  If we accept the Christian narrative at face value, there was a new star in the heavens appearing before the Messianic birth: a star in the east and wonders in the heavens.  The interchange between Herod and the "wise men" may suggest that many, many celestial events were occuring, so it was difficult to ascertain which sign was the prophetic one.

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript and its editorialization.

My current understanding is that the word "Shazer" was the marker of the 600 year prophecy.  It represented the birth of Jacob, Nephi's younger brother.  And at his birth, there were many signs in the heavens.  "Shazer" (rudimentary definition being: Sha [garden] - zer [birth]) is what I would classify as a superword in Nephi's language (which interestingly Joseph Smith described when discussing Egyptian later in his life: one or two symbols could tell an entire story).  The two word stems can tell an entire story, and this was a teaching device: a sacred grove of almond trees, early spring, snow or blossoms dropping like snow or both, a difficult birth in a garden with an umbilical complication, a sharp knife, a fire, and so on.  This was the birth of Jacob!

If we can calculate when the family left Jerusalem, then we would know what year the Messiah was born.  And vice versa.  For example, the family can easily move within/without the city walls, so this puts a constraint on the potential year - the city could not be under seige.  Now the data of Samuel the Lamanite offers another boundary condition.  Many signs already had appeared and Samuel clarified that the ultimate sign would not occur for 5 more years.  So what was a significant sign with which they were familiar as a culture, that was not the ultimate sign?  And, what would the ultimate sign be?


#### Celestial anchor: Lyra Comet 1P
NASA has data on various heavenly events, and many of those are cyclical which means they can be estimated if not recorded or referenced in wrriten observations.  During the family journey described in 1 Nephi, there was an unusual cluster of solar/lunar eclipses with totalities visible within the Arabian peninsula.  In addition, a famous comet may have appeared during that time frame (Astophysicists use the cyclical nature of the comet and estimates sightings that are not readily available in written documents).

One of the most famous phenomenon we call the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.  I will give it a more time-honored name, the Comet Lyra or Comet 1P from Lyra.  Joseph Smith observed this phenomenon in 1835 and discussed it as an important sign and wonder of the heavens (and Mark Twain even has a unique relationship with this comet).  The comet Lyra has a cycle (shaw-nah, H8138) that is approximately 75 years: more or less depending on whether the comet gets close to a planet when it enters the planetary region of the solar system and is effected by local gravity.  In addition, the mass of the comet would likely be reduced over time as it emits a stream of material which could possibly create a time trend. 

So maybe the 600-year prophecy was anchored to, or computed from,  the appearance of this comet?  "Bright light" is one meaning of "Shazer" representing both a celestial phenomenon in the heavens as well as the celestial miracle on the earth: the birth of a child as a gift of light (e.g., [dar la luz] in Spanish: a crown of flowing light, see H2213 H2215 H2224 H2225 and so on).  Maybe part of "Shazer" was the appearance of this comet and the prophesy recorded by Lehi was something like: this sign in the heaven will appear eight more times in the next six hundred years (75 x 8 = 600); then, a new star will appear; and then, the Messiah will be born.

If so, the people of Nephi would have likely tracked each occurrence of the cyclical appearance of this comet.  Since the cyclical appearance fluctuates, maybe the data varied within 72-78 year window.  Using modern engineering notation, we would say 75 ± 3 years to capture the uncertainty. 

The people of Nephi considered the age of a man to be about 72 years, why was this?  Was it because the founder [ni] lived to this age?  Or was it anchored to the cyclical nature of this comet?  Again, one must read each number judiciously:  maybe Joseph originally voiced 75 which ultimately was recorded as 72.  Any literal reading should be done cautiously given the nature of the translation process (with or without any editorialization).

And the cosmic cycle of the comet would seem to continue to be an important sign of the heavens for the Ancient Americans.  Maybe it was part of the 2100-year "Colon-mbia" prediction.  Cahokia seems to have been established around 1066 (a final gathering of the cousins) and then disbanded after 1441 (well before Colon-mbia in 1492).  This presents the possibility that "Colon-mbia" was also a timed prophecy of 2100 years: 600 + 600 + 600 + 300 = 28 cycles of 75 = 35 cycles of 60.  

##### Six-hundred year prophecy 
To clarify the six-hundred year prophecy, we need to consider the potential relevance of the comet.  According to our understanding of one historical Chinese astronomical record, a comet believed to be Lyra 1P appeared in 12 BC (26 August - 20 October).  This would be an anchor for the Messianic birth, as it is in the neighborhood for an appropriate date.  So, did this same comet also appear in 612 BC?   According to a different Chinese record, a comet appeared in the autumn of 614 BC (Table II, [https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1982JBAA...92..209B]).  Given the limited data, we may reasonably conclude that this comet was also Lyra 1P.

Anchored to our current assumptions of a solar year, the two appearances occurred a little over 600 years apart: maybe 602 years, two and a half months.  Should we conclude that the  prophecy was literally that number, or was the prophecy anchored to the appearance of the cyclical Lyra 1P Comet with its deviations?  What did Joseph original voice?  That is, if Joseph voiced 602 years, would Sidney have edited the number to 600 based on his knowledge of biblical numerology, specifically the story of Noah?  It is worth noting that no one on the editorial staff for the Book of Mormon (or in the inner circle of the early Church) had significant mathematical prowess.

##### Samuel the Lamanite 
Next, consider the data we can derive from story of Samuel the Lamanite.  Celestial events were being observed.  And, if Comet Lyra was part of the prophecy, it would be considered to be an important marker.  Likely, Samuel used the appearance of the comet to remind the people of the entire prophesy.    Maybe Samuel the Lamanite did indeed say 5 years.  If so, did that mean exactly 5 years?  Or within 5 years?  Maybe Samuel said exactly 3 years and 7 months?  Or maybe "15 days after the fourth vernal equinox?"   If the published deviates from the actual, the question would remain:  what would motivate such an editorialization?

And what precisely was the official sign of the Messianic birth: a night without darkness (that would be visible globally, not just hemispherically)?  The description may suggest the new star was a supernova event (Kepler held this belief) or a two-star-merging anova.  Did Joseph Smith or his editorial staff know of Kepler's estimation and work this detail into the narrative?  Or did Joseph receive an ancient narrative about Samuel the Lamanite, from which, editorialization may occur?

#### Times and Seasons:  Bookends of the Messianic Life 
Intersecting all available data, I currently conclude that the Messianic birth occurred 5 April 8 BC.  Or maybe 6 April based on Joseph Smith's statement.  This aligns with a Chinese celebration of Qingming: bright lights, sweeping the tombs of the ancestors, and a vague master-servant relationship.  The Chinese had a four-pillars calendar based exclusively on the sun, but the modern lunar-solar calendar will suffice to demonstrate that 8 BC is the year of the Water Ox.  And interestingly, this coincides with the year -600 in the Bengali calendar.

##### Year of the Water Ox 
The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".

So if the Messianic birth was 5 April 8 BC, when was the Messianic death?  This birth anchor is earlier than most would allow given traditions of when the death occurred and the Herod-death constraints.  Again, assuming the Christian tradition at face value (there are also obvious motivations for editorialization), the wisemen encountered the young Yeshua in Alexandria, Egypt when the boy was about 4 years old.  The Herod timeline could work.

##### Numerology of the Perfect Life: The Christ Number 33
Most also believe that 33 is the perfect Christ number and that he lived to be exactly 33 years.  Tradition is that the Messiah was born 1 AD and died 34 AD.  Most scholars place the Messiah Death Event in the 30-33 AD range.  Which is precisely the range we find in 3 Nephi.  

##### The Messiah Death Event
The death likely occurred on 5 May 31 AD.  There was a solar eclipse over the Japan Sea on that day; the Emperor of China observed the occurence, proclaimed a "Son of the heavens has died" and entered his palace [in mourning] for 5 days.  There was an airburst event over Jerusalem that turned stones on the temple's altar to chalkstone.  This event likely created shockwaves that archaelogists associate with a magnitude 6+ earthquake with an epicenter in the middle of the Dead Sea.  The water level of the Dead Sea immediately dropped 50 feet.  Lilies of the field were decimated according to pollen data replaced by flora that can survive in a more arid environment.  Hearty oliveyards and vineyards suffer and rebound.  Trees that trigger seeding after fire-events (pines and pistachios) flourish.  And so on.  

My calculations have Yeshua being born 5 April 8 BC and dying 5 May 31 AD, living 37 years, 30 days.  Not a full 40 years, but more than 30 years: fulfilling a Jewish tradition.  And interestingly, Joseph Smith when he was that age was pondering death.  In January 1843, Joseph gave a sermon focusing on an Old Testament reference that we as God's pinnacle of creation will one day feed the grasses of the field.

##### Impasse: in the 33rd and 34th year ...
Anchored to a belief of exactness within the Book of Mormon, I was at an impasse. All I had was a comment by scholar Royal Skousen when he concluded from his lifetime of study that "Oliver was tricky."  This means that, according to Royal, Oliver Cowdery would make edits to the manuscript and Joseph kept having to review the work to make certain this did NOT continue.  But now, given that Sidney or Oliver may have intentionally manipulated a few dates to fit their internal belief systems, I could look for a Messiah Death date independent of the constraint found in 3 Nephi.

So the various data all aligned very nicely with the exception of 3 Nephi.  A review of the limited data we have, curated by Royal Skousen, shows that the scribes had crossed-out and replaced at least one date in 3 Nephi.  Maybe to align with Sidney's belief that the Messiah lived a perfect life of 33 years, born 1 AD and died 34 AD (an anchor James Talmage would use in his framing of Jesus the Christ).  

My anchors for the birth/death of the Messiah are from a seemingly uninvolved third party:  China.  Qingming occurs 15 days after the equinox on April 5th-ish and means the celebration of the bright lights or pure lights where the living sweep the tombs of their ancestors (possibly preparing them for a promised ressurrection), the year 8BC is my proposal as the origin of the holiday is unknown (conflated with other holiday, traditions, and stories).  I associate this to the supernova predicting the birth of the Messiah.  

And the death anchored to the observation of a solar eclipse with totality visible in the Sea of Japan, 5 May 31 AD.






### Personal reflection in the limit 
Being raised in the Mormon tradition, it was very difficult to challenge one's own internal belief system.  For me personally, the mathematics was undeniable.  But what are the consequences?  Again, I think about the consequences also in a maths frame.  What is the finite state of the system?  I experience cognitive dissonance, I realize my internal belief system is flawed.  So what do I do?  I could play the Dehlin card and spend the rest of my life feeding the flames of real feelings of perceived betrayal.  Where does that road lead?  What is the finite state of that choice?  Living an angry, bitter life.  No, thank you.

So a mathematician will extend and abstract the consequences before settling on a finite state machine.  The Mormon Church institution manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  Once you get on that train, the conclusions are obvious:  The Christian institution formalized by Constantine and reformed ever since has manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  The Masoretic tradition of Jewish thought manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Now consider the four domains of life: physical (health), education, religion, government/economics as defined by Luke 2:52.  I have outlined just the religious dimension of institutional manipulation.  And for this treatise, let's stay focused on the religious domain although the implications obviously flow into the other three.

Once you conclude that institutions manage information for Ciceran purposes (grow and self-preserve), layering of belief needs to be deconstructed and redeveloped:  my Mormon traditions, the underlying Judeo-Christian traditions, and the underlying American-British-Roman traditions.  Nephi was wise when he observes how the "traditions of the fathers" can easily blind us.

If you distill these realities, the obvious conclusion is that the Messiah Death Event was very significant.  Why else would the Masoretes manipulate the original Passover tradition and invent the golden calf narrative which was non-existent in the Greek Septuagint?  Why would the polytheistic Roman society have a mother-son adopt such a minor monotheistic religion if there was not reason (data we do not currently have) to motivate such adoption?  Interestingly, the best source document we have to unlock the truth about the Messiah Death Event is the Book of Mormon, with all of its editorial editions and flaws.

#### Anchor of Faith: 3 days of darkness 
The anchor remains:  3 Nephi says there was 3 days of darkness whereas Christian tradition defines only 3 hours of darkness.  Certainly Sidney would have known the 3-hour tradition yet the 3-day innovation was included.  Maybe this was something Sidney edited, Oliver implemented, and Joseph Smith corrected.  Those details would be fascinating.

Regardless, why did the polemics of the Mormon movement NOT anchor to this obvious difference?  Why was faith not exercised in the literal words of 3 Nephi.  3 days of darkness!  What can cause 3 days of darkness throughout the world?  The answer is obvious: multiple volcanic eruptions that filled the skies with ash. 

And for the modern Mormon institution, what I describe as the Brigham Synod (the culture of my upbringing), where is the strong stance on this very obvious distinction?  Why is the difference avoided or apologized away?  Talk about the ultimate "click-bait" for a modern discussion:  Mormon Church doubles down on 3 Nephi description of three-days of darkness calling Western traditions of Roman history pure fiction! 

This was the anchor of faith from which Mormonism could have thrived to fulfill the promise of Isaiah:  that the knowledge of Jehovah would fill the world like the waters fill the sea.  Apologists seem to want to make this data point disappear rather than anchor and pivot from it.  If Roman tradition says there was 3 hours of darkness and Nephi tradition says there was 3 days of darkness, who should you believe?  An uninvolved witness half way around the world, or a society directly involved with the Messiah Death Event?

Aha!  Can you see?

###### Implications for Romans crafting history
This unlocks the obvious conclusion that the Romans intentionally lied about the details of the Messiah Death Event, which, in turn, will challenge any detail in Roman history after Julius Caesar:  when did the Pompeii destruction occur?  when and how did Tiberius and Caligula die?


If the Book of Mormon is literally true, why has the Mormon Church never double-downed on the distinction of 3 days NOT 3 hours? Now, as I reflect on my journey, I have concluded that during the Joseph Smith era, everyone understood that Joseph as Prophet received novel content that was organized into the Book of Mormon with the help of his scribes.  If true, such an objective anchor would NOT be so objective for those living in that era.  

But what of the modern movement?  Does it also have knowledge that such a distinction (3 days, not 3 hours) may have been an editorialization?  

Regardless, stepping forward with faith that the 3 days of darknesses was not edited by Oliver or Sidney, the implications are tremendous.  

The Messiah Death Event was much worse than you can imagine.  More brutal for those tortured AND the Apocalyptic Celestial Response *was* Epic.  There are plenty of clues remaining to this reality, a trinity of triangulating testimonies:  Psalms (20-24), Isaiah (20-24), and Matthew (20-24).  Rome does not recover to take the city of Jerusalem until 70 AD (soldiers die, power structures are destabilized), Roman "historians" begin recrafting a narrative in 100 AD:  Josephus to develop messaging for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger to develop messaging for a Roman audience.

And that, my dear reader, is the seed needed to move forward.  To reconstruct your understanding of the Messiah Death Event.  To unlock how instutitions manipulate you to thrive and grow:  in healthcare, in education, in religion, in government/economics/politics.  To enable you to understand the purpose of this planet [mor-mon-ya] and your celestial heritage.

Godspeed.  Namaste.
