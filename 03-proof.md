### Proof the underlying text is an Ancient American Record 

When you discuss 'burden of proof', where does the burden fall?  An apologist gets trapped into attempts on defending every anachronism or inconsistency.  This is the fatal flaw of the apologist.  The antagonists try to frame the argument illogically, not being well versed in the logical fallacy Karl Popper defined as the falsification principle, aka the "Black Swan" problem.  Just because you have never seen a black swan, that does not mean they don't exist. Apologists like to coin this logical frame as "a lack of evidence is not evidence of lack".   The falsification principle defines where the burden of proof lies.  Antagonists try to switch the frame using anachronistic arguments about horses or steel or (insert anachronism here).

The Book of Mormon as a thing exists.  If you want to take an antagonist view, you have to demonstrate where and how it came about.  Joseph Smith offered one explanation, the burden of proof is to offer a counter-explanation.  Any serious student will dismiss the Solomon Spaulding or Captain Kidd or View of Hebrews (or even Last of the Mohicans - another literary work Mark Twain despised).  Computational linguistics (using latent semantic analysis, cosine similarity for document correlations) is one area of personal expertise, and nothing significant in this literary comparison has merit.

Hebrew poetic forms like chaismic structure seems to be available for consideration.  Most notable are the King Benjamin speech and Alma 36.  How can one explain how such poetry was crafted?  And that it was only used at certain times and places?  Within context of the internal narrative, the change-point to introduced chiasmic poetry is consistent.  The people of Nephi spoke the Egyptian language and had the learning of the Jews.  The people of Mulek were nobles and likely were educated in many languages:  Egyptian, Hebrew, Assyrian, and Babylonian.  However, they did not have any written records with them so relied on oral traditions, likely Hebrew.  And the Hebrew oral traditions were likely used as memory devices.  About 400 years later, these two societies collided.    Now, when these two societies merge into one, there will be knowledge spillover and adoption.  The people of Nephi have written records, superior weaponry and a superior economic system.  So naturally, they become the rulers although the kingmen don't fully agree (Judah carries the scepter) as will be demonstrated within a few years.  With all of that being said, King Benjamin used chiasmic structure in his famous speech: likely as a sign of good will to connect the two traditions.  Maybe chiasmic structure existed before among the people of Nephi, but with the data we have, it seems to be the joining of the people of Mulek with the people of Nephi was indeed a change point.  

And after the merger, Mormon made it very clear that language further evolved (devolved) into something that would not be understood by the ancients.  Interestingly, when Mormon discovers the small plates, it seems as if he is able to easily able to understand the ancient language.  Was Mormon able to read the narrative of Lehi so easily as well?  Of note, is the change-point for Mormon personally upon discovering these small plates with the first leaf being darkened.  No longer does he declare "I am a descendant of Lehi" (3 Nephi); now he declares "I am a descendant of Nephi" (Words of Mormon).  Something therein Nephi wrote clarified to Mormon his genealogy.  But where and what?  

Mormon also wrote to his son Moroni a letter, sharing with his son that he (Mormon) finally figured out what his name meant.  Before, he described himself as Mormon, the son of Mormon, named after the Waters of Mormon (the story of Alma).  Now he writes to his son the meaning of his name.  And Joseph Smith shared this meaning later to those around him:  God's love or good love.  Imagine the debate that must have followed:  'Mormon is the name of the author of the book, it does not mean God's love Joseph.  Charity means God's love!'

So, Sidney Rigdon, steeped in the Pauline epistles and traditional wisdom took it upon himself to expand the original terse letter between a father and son: "dear son, I figured out that my name Mormon means God's love or the good love.  love, dad".  A classic Sidney introjection, demonstrating his acumen with Pauline philosophy expands the letter:  "Charity is the pure love of Christ..."  The simplicity of the original authentic dialogue is what I want to read.  One day.

Taken altogether, I have included the stem [mor-mon-ya] in my estimation of the first phrase written by Nephi in his small plates, the legend of Nephi.  This certainly would capture Mormon's attention.  And it is a reference to Egyptian mythology that we (humans) are descended from the celestial (the gods) who came on a vessel (boat or ship) from a sacred water (lake).  A much different view of our origins than a modern Judeo-Christian norm.

Certainly Joseph Smith was engaged in expanding such views:  [elohim] as a plurality of gods, eternal progression to become a god, and the glory of god being the experience and learning obtained in this life.  Very far removed from a monotheistic view that evolved (or devolved) following the Messiah Death Event; of which, the Masoretes were intentional in removing the notion of polytheism in their efforts to preserve their legacy and remain relevant.

Interesting, there are many "poly" innovations that Joseph Smith suggested:  polytheism, polygenesis, polyamory to name the big 3.  If Nephi had ingrained these concepts in his worldview and writings, where they blatantly removed by the intellectualism of Sidney?

#### Concise proof:  And my father dwelt in a tent.
This is the best phrase I can use as a concise proof:  "And my father dwelt in a tent."  First, this phrase exists.  Second, Sidney would have no reason whatsoever to editorialize this phrase.  Third, it visually displays the context of what is also vocalized.  Fourth, it is both a visual and vocal palindrome.  Fifth, its implications are profound.

I estimate that the statement is surrounded in "lamads" like we would surround a dictation with appropriate quotation marks.  Notice, it does NOT say "And it came to pass" in this instance.  Without the lamads, the phrase would be:  "v-ab-ee sh ee-ab-v".  With the lamads: "l-v-ab-ee sh ee-ab-v-l".  The [sh] may be a compound making the phrase 10 or 12 symbols; if a single [sh], the phrase would be 9 or 11 symbols.  I estimate the [sh] in "l-v-ab-ee sh ee-ab-v-l" represents the center of the family living, the warmth of the gathering:  warm milk for the little ones, and warm comfort from mother to father.  The symbols described how family life existed, what some modern readers may call a nomadic living arrangment.  On the left side is a pillar of protection, followed by a cow and a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The left side is the feminine.  The place for mother and children to take care of feminine activities:  milk the female cow, gather the eggs from female birds, kill/prepare the smaller animals to eat such as female birds, and bake breads that rise.  The right side is symmetric:  a pillar of protection, a cow [likely male], a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The right side is the masculine.  The place for father and pubescent sons to take care of the masculine activities:  protect the borders, watch the herds, slaughter the cow/goat/lamb and cook the meat of larger animals, do the man's work.  The union of these separate activities is the [sh] in the middle, that represents the breasts of a woman.  She uses the breasts to merge the activities of the feminine and masculine into a cohesive society.  The breast literally nourishes the children (left side).  The breast literally comforts/entices and brings a fire to the parental congress (right side).  This parallel masculine/feminine structure can be seen in the design within the temple of Jehovah that Solomon builded:  5 menorah with the feminine date palm on the left; 5 menorah with the masculine date palm on the right; and in the holy of holies a female cherub (cow with wings) on the left with the wing touching the male cherub (bull with wings) on the right to cover the Ark of the Covenant in the middle: 5 + 5 + 1 = 11.  Said Ark was a seat where two could sit: likely the female on the left (Asherah / Ishtar / Isis) and the male on the right (El / Jehovah / Osiris).  

With one phrase, Nephi could educate his children how a society best operates.  This is the true form of harem living that has been historically miscontrued as something altogether different.  It is an exogamic society where the daughters stay in the village where they were raised and the boys move to join another village and marry females that are not milk-sisters.  Interdependence of the genders.

Students of biblical Hebrew will object to the inexactness of the above translation process based on the belief that their current understanding of Hebrew is the benchmark forgetting that biblical Hebrew is a broken language.  I need to emphasize: the language of Nephi is NOT a broken language.  And therein is a significant implication.  Nephi's language can help restore the broken Hebrew and the lost Egyptian.  It is like a Rosetta stone, but so much more.  As Joseph Smith described:  it is the keystone of religion.  Not just Judeo-Christian religion, nor Abrahamic religion.  It is the keystone of all religion.  Religion means to "bind again" and the language and teachings of Nephi will empower us with the knowledge to be "bound again" to our celestial heritage.  Many may describe such a claim as esoteric, and it may be so.  Joseph Smith was an innovator born in a traditional Christian era, and the innovations he received got pigeon-holed into the Christian frame yet a universal religion may have been part of his effort.


#### Summary
A mathematician likes to examine the essence of a problem and then present a proof in a minimal form.  I could use other examples, but this one example, is sufficient.  Interestingly, Nephi also offers a similar minimal proof using Isaiah to demonstrate that the man to be born in the flash as the Messiah was a seraph on the right hand of God in the celestial.  The flaming fiery serpent, a descendent of Ahaz was the same seraph that placed a fiery coal on Isaiah's tongue when Isaiah was called.  The Messiah was the Son of God, a simple proof Nephi points out in his educational "plain and precious" teachings for his children.

#### How
Many times a mathematician working on a proof does NOT reveal the minutiae that led to the distilled essence and result.  So, it can be difficult to under "how" one arrived at that conclusion.  For me, an independent study of the times and seasons associated with the birth and death of Yeshua in association to the numbers provided in the Book of Mormon was the key data that has put me on a path of rediscovery challenging my internal belief systems; at the time, this could be tied directly to Oliver:  could Oliver have intentionally changed numbers to fit his belief system that would disrupt my calculations?  

Once you conclude that institutions manage information for Ciceran purposes (grow and self-preserve), layering of belief needs to be deconstructed:  my Mormon traditions, the underlying Judeo-Christian traditions, and the underlying American-British-Roman traditions.  Nephi was wise when he observes how the "traditions of the fathers" can easily blind us.

For me, the anchor point is the number 600.  The six hundred year prophecy between leaving Jerusalem and the birth of the Messiah.  And, this same number is found in the story of Noah.  And this number is associated with Muhammed (his wisdom received on his hijra was 622, so was he born in 592?).  And in my studies, there may be some connection to the Bengali calendar of the Gangan tradition.

The number 600 is the beginning.  With 12 as an embedded factor, this is a perfect number.  Some key ways of arriving at 600 are:  60 × 10; 75 x 8; 50 x 12.  Of note, is the Noah reference to the same number in his timeline.  Anchored to a Christian belief that Yeshua was born around year 0 (in a mathematician's dating system), 600 BC and 600 AD are important markers.  Maybe 600 AD is anchored to the wisdom of Muhammad before his hijra in 622.  Maybe Moses or Joseph or Abraham was born in the 600 year cycle.  Noah has a referential anchor to this number.  Maybe the great Buddha is an anchor as well, not limiting the cycle to the Abrahamic tradition.

The Chinese have a 60 year cycle based on the heaven stems (12) and the earth stems (5) which are decomposed of 5 elements (五行 wuxing): Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood (and the duality of the yin-yang, so technically 120).  

The symbol for the number 10 in Chinese is the same symbol as the original [tav] of Ancient Hebrew, the symbol of the cross.  The Roman Numeral was merely a rotation of [+] to form an [X].  One of the fundamental earth-stem elements is Water.  And this begins the relationship.  

Every 60 years, 5 earth stems pass through 12 heaven stems where the heaven stems are today associated with an animal and an etiological story of a race describes the order.  The first animal is the Rat, followed by the Ox.  The Ox gave the Rat a ride for a large portion of the race and either the Rat deceived the Ox to win OR the Ox allowed the Rat to win ('you go a head').  

The Book of Mormon prophesy was precise, 600 years.  Certainly the Messianic birth is part of the prophecy.  What is the other anchor exactly?  Was it also a birth?  If so, who was born?  If we accept the Christian narrative at face value, there was a new star in the heavens appearing before the Messianic birth: a star in the east and wonders in the heavens.  The interchange between Herod and the "wise men" may suggest that many, many celestial events were occuring, so it was difficult to ascertain which sign was the prophetic one.

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript.

My current understanding is that the word "Shazer" was the marker of the 600 year prophecy.  It represented the birth of Jacob, Nephi's younger brother.  And at his birth, there were many signs in the heavens.  "Shazer" (rudimentary definition being: Sha [garden] - zer [birth]) is what I would classify as a superword in Nephi's language (which interestingly Joseph Smith described when discussing Egyptian later in his life: one or two symbols could tell an entire story).  The two word stems can tell an entire story, and this was a teaching device: a sacred grove of almond trees, early spring, snow or blossoms dropping like snow or both, a difficult birth in a garden with an umbilical complication, a sharp knife, a fire, and so on.  This was the birth of Jacob!

If we can calculate when the family left Jerusalem, then we would know what year Yeshua was born.  And vice versa.  For example, the family can easily move within/without the city walls, so this puts a constraint on the potential year - the city could not be under seige.  Now the data of Samuel the Lamanite offers another boundary condition.  Many signs already had appeared and Samuel clarified that the ultimate sign would not occur for 5 more years.  So what was a significant sign with which they were familiar as a culture, that was not the ultimate sign?  And, what would the ultimate sign be?

NASA has data on heavenly events, and those that are cyclical can be estimated.  During the family journey described in 1 Nephi, there was an unusual cluster of solar/lunar eclipses with epicenters near the Arabian peninsula.  In addition, a famous comet may have appeared during that time phrame (Astophysicists use the cyclical nature of the comet and estimates sightings that are not readily available in written documents).

One of the most famous phenomenon we call the comet of Halley, attributed to a British astronomer born in 1600s.  I will give it a more time-honored name, the comet Lyra or 1P from Lyra.  Joseph Smith observed this phenomenon in 1835 and discussed it as an important sign and wonder of the heavens (and Mark Twain even has a unique relationship with this comet).  The comet Lyra has a cycle that is approximately 75 years: more or less depending on whether the comet gets close to a planet when it enters the planetary region of the solar system and is effected by local gravity.  In addition, the mass of the comet would likely be reduced over time as it emits a stream of material. 

So maybe the 600-year cycle could be computed using this comet.  Maybe part of "Shazer" was the appearance of this comet and the prophesy recorded by Lehi was something like: this sign in the heaven will appear eight more times in the next six hundred years; then the Messiah will be born: 75 x 8 = 600.

If so, the people of Nephi would have likely tracked each occurrence.  Since the cyclical appearance fluctuates, maybe the data varied within 72-78 year window.  Using modern engineering notation, we would say 75 ± 3 years to capture the uncertainty.  

The comet may have appeared in 12 BC (26 August - 20 October) according to our understanding of historical Chinese records.  So, did it also appear in 612 BC? According to a different Chinese record, a comet appeared in the autumn of 614 BC (Table II, [https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1982JBAA...92..209B]). 

Next consider the data we can derive from story of Samuel the Lamanite.  Celestial events were being observed.  And, if comet Lyra was part of the prophecy, it would be considered to be an important marker.  Likely, Samuel used the appearance of the comet to remind the people of the entire prophesy.  The people of Nephi considered the age of a man to be about 72 years, why was this?  Was it because the founder [ni] lived to this age?  Or was it anchored to the cyclical nature of this comet?  Again, one must read this number judiciously:  maybe Joseph originally voiced 75 which ultimately was recorded as 72.  And similarly, maybe Samuel the Lamanite did indeed say 5 years.  If so, did that mean exactly 5 years?  Or within 5 years?  And what precisely the official sign of the Messianic birth?  The description may suggest a new star was a supernova event.  Kepler also held this hypothesis.

Intersecting all available data, I currently conclude that the Messianic birth occurred 5 April 8 BC.  Or maybe 6 April based on Joseph Smith's statement.  This aligns with a Chinese celebration of Qingming: bright lights, sweeping the tombs of the ancestors, and a vague master-servant relationship.  The Chinese had a four-pillars calendar based exclusively on the sun, but the modern lunar-solar calendar will suffice to demonstrate that 8 BC is the year of the Water Ox.  And interestingly, is the year -600 in the Bengali calendar.

The original Chinese glyphs which are interpreted as "the year of the Water Ox" actually have more primitive roots [https://hanzicraft.com/character/癸丑年]:  [one-big-footsteps] + [two-knife] (ugly/shame) + [bend-one-ten] (year).  An obvious interpretation of "the year of the Water Ox" could be the "year where one takes big steps carrying a double-edged sword".

This is another anchor for the Messianic birth.  And the cosmic cycle of the comet would seem to continue to be an important sign of the heavens for the Ancient Americans.  Maybe it was part of the 2100-year "Colon-mbia" prediction.  Cahokia seems to have been established around 1066 (a final gathering of the cousins) and then disbanded after 1441 (well before Colon-mbia in 1492).  This presents the possibility that "Colon-mbia" was also a timed prophecy of 2100 years: 600 + 600 + 600 + 300 = 28 cycles of 75 = 35 cycles of 60.  

So if the Messianic birth was 5 April 8 BC, when was the Messianic death?  This birth anchor is earlier than most allow given traditions of when the death occurred and the Herod-death constraints.  Again, assuming the Christian tradition at face value (there are also obvious motivations for editorialization), the wisemen encountered the young Yeshua in Alexandria Egypt when the boy was about 4 years old.  The Herod timeline could work.

Most also believe that 33 is the perfect Christ number and that he lived to be exactly 33 years.  Tradition is that the Messiah was born 1 AD and died 34 AD.  Most scholars place the Messiah Death Event in the 30-33 AD range.  Which is precisely the range we find in 3 Nephi.  Anchored to a belief of exactness within the Book of Mormon, I was at an impasse.  But now, given that Sidney or Oliver may have intentionally manipulated a few dates to fit their internal belief systems, I could look for a Messiah Death date independent of the constraint found in 3 Nephi.

The death likely occurred on 5 May 31 AD.  There was a solar eclipse over the Japan Sea on that day; the Emperor of China observed the occurence, proclaimed a "Son of the heavens has died" and entered his palace [in mourning] for 5 days.  There was an earthquake of magnitude 6+ with an epicenter in the middle of the Dead Sea in that time window.  There was an airburst event over Jerusalem that decimated pollen of the Olive trees and the Lilies of the Field for a few decades; and thereafter, more arid plants thrived in the region.  And so on.  This unlocks the obvious conclusion that the Romans intentionally lied about the details of the Messiah Death Event, which, in turn, will challenge any Roman history after Julius Caesar:  when did the Pompeii destruction occur?  when and how did Tiberius and Caligula die?

So the various data all aligned very nicely with the exception of 3 Nephi.  A review of the limited data we have, curated by Royal Skousen, shows that the scribes had crossed-out and replaced at least one date in 3 Nephi.  Maybe to align with Sidney's belief that the Messiah lived a perfect life of 33 years, born 1 AD and died 34 AD (an anchor James Talmage would use in his framing of Jesus the Christ).

My calculations have Yeshua being born 5 April 8 BC and dying 5 May 31 AD, living 37 years, 30 days.  Not a full 40 years, but more than 30 years: fulfilling a Jewish tradition.  And interestingly, Joseph Smith when he was that age was pondering death.  In January 1843, Joseph gave a sermon focusing on an Old Testament reference that we as God's pinnacle of creation will one day feed the grasses of the field.

#### So what 
Being raised in the Mormon tradition, it was very difficult to challenge one's own internal belief system.  For me personally, the mathematics was undeniable.  But what are the consequences?  Again, I think about the consequences also in a maths frame.  What is the finite state of the system?  I experience cognitive dissonance, I realize my internal belief system is flawed.  So what do I do?  I could play the Dehlin card and spend the rest of my life feeding the flames of real feelings of perceived betrayal.  Where does that road lead?  What is the finite state of that choice?  Living an angry, bitter life.  No thank you.

So a mathematician will extend and abstract the consequences before settling on a finite state machine.  The Mormon Church institution manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  Once you get on that train, the conclusions are obvious:  The Christian institution formalized by Constantine and reformed ever since has manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  The Masoretic tradition of Jewish thought manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Now consider the four domains of life: physical (health), education, religion, government/economics as defined by Luke 2:52.  I have outlined just the religious dimension of institutional manipulation.  And for this treatise, let's stay focused on the religious domain although the implications obviously flow into the other three.

If you distill these realities, the obvious conclusion is that the Messiah Death Event was very significant.  Why else would the Masoretes manipulate the original Passover tradition and invent the golden calf narrative which was non-existent in the Greek Septuagint?  Why would the polytheistic Roman society have a mother-son adopt such a minor monotheistic religion if there was not reason (data we do not currently have) to motivate such adoption?  Interestingly, the best source document we have to unlock the truth about the Messiah Death Event is the Book of Mormon, with all of its editorial editions and flaws.

The anchor remains:  3 Nephi says there was 3 days of darkness whereas Christian tradition defines only 3 hours of darkness.  Certainly Sidney would have known the 3-hour tradition yet the 3-day innovation was included.  Maybe this was something Sidney edited, Oliver implemented, and Joseph Smith corrected.  Those details would be fascinating.

Regardless, why did the polemics of the Mormon movement NOT anchor to this obvious difference?  Why was faith not exercised in the literal words of 3 Nephi.   

And for the modern Mormon institution, what I describe as the Brigham Synod (the culture of my upbringing), where is the strong stance on this very obvious distinction?  Why is the difference avoided or apologizes away?  Talk about the ultimate "click-bait" for a modern discussion:  Mormon Church doubles down on 3 Nephi description of three-days of darkness calling Western traditions of Roman history pure fiction! 

This was the anchor of faith from which Mormonism could have thrived to fulfill the promise of Isaiah:  that the knowledge of Jehovah would fill the world like the waters fill the sea.  Apologists seem to want to make this data point disappear rather than anchor and pivot from it.  If Roman tradition says there was 3 hours of darkness and Nephi tradition says there was 3 days of darkness, who should you believe?  An uninvolved witness half way around the world, or a society directly involved with the Messiah Death Event?

Aha!  Can you see?

If the Book of Mormon is literally true, why has the Mormon Church never double-downed on the distinction of 3 days NOT 3 hours? Now, as I reflect on my journey, I have concluded that during the Joseph Smith era, everyone understood that Joseph as Prophet received novel content that was organized into the Book of Mormon with the help of his scribes.  If true, such an objective anchor would NOT be so objective.  Joseph may have even pulled a few of the faithful aside and privately shared what was originally said before the collaboration.  Consider for example the meaning of the word "Mormon" according to Joseph Smith.  Where and how was that clarity shared?  

But what of the modern movement?  Does it also have knowledge that such a distinction (3 days, not 3 hours) may have been an editorialization?  

Regardless, stepping forward with faith that the 3 days of darknesses was not edited by Oliver or Sidney, the implications are tremendous.  

The Messiah Death Event was much worse than you can imagine.  More brutal for those tortured AND the Apocalyptic Celestial Response *was* Epic.  There are plenty of clues remaining to this reality, a trinity of triangulating testimonies:  Psalms (20-24), Isaiah (20-24), and Matthew (20-24).  Rome does not recover to take the city of Jerusalem until 70 AD, Roman "historians" begin recrafting a narrative in 100 AD:  Josephus to develop messaging for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger to develop messaging for a Roman audience.

And that, my dear reader, is the seed needed to move forward.  To reconstruct your understanding of the Messiah Death Event.  To unlock how instutitions manipulate you to thrive and grow:  in healthcare, in education, in religion, in government/economics/politics.  To enable you to understand the purpose of this planet [mor-mon-ya] and your celestial heritage.

Godspeed.  Namaste.
