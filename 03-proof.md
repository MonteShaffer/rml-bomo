### Proof the underlying text is an Ancient American Record 

When you discuss 'burden of proof', where does the burden fall?  An apologist gets trapped into attempts on defending every anachronism or inconsistency.  This is the fatal flaw of the apologist.  The antagonists try to frame the argument illogically, not being well versed in the logical fallacy Karl Popper defined as the falsification principle, aka the "Black Swan" problem.  Just because you have never seen a black swan, that does not mean they don't exist. Apologists like to coin this logical frame as "a lack of evidence is not evidence of lack".   The falsification principle defines where the burden of proof lies.  Antagonists try to switch the frame using anachronistic arguments about horses or steel or (insert anachronism here).

The Book of Mormon as a thing exists.  If you want to take an antagonist view, you have to demonstrate where and how it came about.  Joseph Smith offered one explanation, the burden of proof is to offer a counter-explanation.  Any serious student will dismiss the Salamander or Captain Kidd or View of Hebrews (or even Last of the Mohicans - another literary work Mark Twain despised).  Computational linguistics and document correlations is one area of personal expertise, and nothing significant in this literary comparison has merit.

Hebrew poetic forms like chaismic structure seems to be available for consideration with the King Benjamin speech and Alma 36 being key demonstrations.  These are valid yet are post-merger between the Egyptian language of Nephi and the Hebrew oral traditions of the people of Mulek.  To me, the prevalence of its use in the King Benjamin speech is an effort to unite two peoples but also a pleasant memory of oral traditional poetry that may have been lost to the people of Nephi.  

And after the merger, Mormon made it very clear that language further evolved (devolved) into something that would not be understood by the ancients.  Interestingly, when Mormon discovers the small plates, it seems as if he is able to easily able to understand the ancient language.  Was Mormon able to read the narrative of Lehi so easily as well?  Of note, is the change-point for Mormon personally upon discovered these small plates with the first leaf being darkened.  No longer does he declare "I am a descendant of Lehi" (3 Nephi); now he declares "I am a descendant of Nephi" (Words of Mormon).  Something therein Nephi wrote clarified to Mormon his genealogy.  But where and what?  

Mormon also wrote to his son Moroni a letter, sharing with his son that he (Mormon) finally figured out what his name meant.  Before, he described himself as Mormon, the son of Mormon, named after the Waters of Mormon (the story of Alma).  Now he writes to his son the meaning of his name.  And Joseph Smith shared this meaning later to those around him:  God's love or good love.  Yet, Sidney Rigdon, who was steeped in the Pauline epistles needed to expand and pontificate a short yet meaning exchange between Mormon and his son Moroni.  "Charity is the pure love of Christ" is a classic Sidney introjection, an entire sermon it would seem.  The simplicity of the original authentic dialogue is what I want to read.  One day.

Therein is the inclusion of the stem [mor-mon-ya] in the first estimated phrase of the legend of Nephi.  This certainly would capture Mormon's attention.  And it is a reference to Egyptian mythology that we (humans) are descended from the celestial (the gods) who came on a vessel (boat or ship) from a sacred water (lake).  Joseph Smith was engaged in expanding such views:  [elohim] as a plurality of gods, eternal progression to become a god, and the glory of god being the experience and learning obtained in this life.  Very far removed from a monotheistic view that evolved (or devolved) following the Messiah Death Event; of which, the Masoretes were intentional in removing the notion of polytheism in their efforts to preserve their legacy and remain relevant.

Interesting, there are many "poly" innovations that Joseph Smith suggested:  polytheism, polygenesis, polyamory to name the big 3.  If Nephi had ingrained these concepts in his worldview and writings, where they blatantly removed by the intellectualism of Sidney?

#### Concise proof:  And my father dwelt in a tent.
This is the best phrase I can use as a concise proof.  First, Sidney would have no reason whatsoever to editorialize this phrase.  Second, it visually displays the context of what is also vocalized.  Third, it is both a visual and vocal palindrome.  Fourth, its implications are profound.

I estimate that the statement is surrounded in "lamads" like we would surround a dictation with appropriate quotation marks.  Notice, it does NOT say "And it came to pass" in this instance.  Without the lamads, the phrase would be:  "v-ab-ee sh ee-ab-v".  With the lamads: "l-v-ab-ee sh ee-ab-v-l".  The [sh] may be a compound making the phrase 10 or 12 symbols; if a single [sh], the phrase would be 9 or 11 symbols.  The symbols described how family life existed, what some modern readers may call a nomadic living arrangment.  On the left side is a pillar or protection, followed by a cow and a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The left side is the feminine.  The place for mother and children to take care of feminine activities:  milk the female cow, gather the female eggs from birds, kill/prepare the smaller animals to eat such as birds, and bake breads that rise.  The right side is symmetric:  a pillar and protect, a cow, a house or tent and a hand to do the work.  The right side is the masculine.  The place for father and pubescent sons to take care of the masculine activities:  protect the borders, slaughter the cow and cook the meat of larger animals, do the man's work.  The union of these separate activities is the [sh] in the middle, that represents the breasts of a woman.  She uses the breasts to merge the activities of the feminine and masculine into a cohesive society.  The breast nourishes the children and comforts/entices the father in marital congress.  This parallel can be seen in the building structure on the temple grounds of Jehovah that Solomon builded:  5 menorah with the feminine date palm on the left; 5 menorah with the masculine date palm on the right; and in the holy of holies a female cherub (cow with wings) on the left with the wing touching the male cherub (bull with wings) on the right to cover the Ark of the Covenant in the middle.  Said Ark was a seat where two could sit: likely the female on the left (Asherah / Ishtar / Isis) and the male on the right (El / Jehovah / Osiris).  

With one phrase, Nephi could educate his children how a society best operates.  This is the true form of harem living that has been historically miscontrued as something altogether different.  It is an exogamic society where the daughters stay in the village where they were raised and the boys move to join another village and marry females that are not milk-sisters.  Interdependence of the genders.

Students of biblical Hebrew will object to the inexactness of the translation process based on the belief that biblical Hebrew is NOT a broken language.  The language of Nephi is NOT a broken language.  And therein is a significant implication.  Nephi's language can help restore the broken Hebrew and the lost Egyptian.  It is like a Rosetta stone, but so much more.  As Joseph Smith described:  it is the keystone of religion.  Not just Judeo-Christian religion, nor Abrahamic religion.  It is the keystone of all religion.  Religion means to "bind again" and the language and teachings of Nephi will enable us all bound again with our celestial heritage.  Many may describe such a claim as esoteric, and it may be so.  Joseph Smith was an innovator born in a traditional Christian era, and the innovations he received got pigeon-holed into that framework.  Nephi's belief system was altered in the editorial process.

#### Summary
A mathematician likes to examine the essence of a problem and then present a proof in a minimal form.  I could use other examples, but this one example, is sufficient.  Interestingly, this same minimal proof is used by Nephi as he utilizes Isaiah to prove that the man to be born in the flesh as the Messiah was in fact, on the right hand of God in the celestial before.  The flaming fiery serpent, a descendent of Ahaz was the same seraph that placed a fiery coal on Isaiah's tongue when Isaiah was called.  The Messiah was the Son of God, a simple proof Nephi points out in his educational "plain and precious" teachings for his children.
