### Proof the underlying text is an Ancient American Record 

When you discuss 'burden of proof', where does the burden fall?  An apologist gets trapped into attempts on defending every anachronism or inconsistency.  This is the fatal flaw of the apologist.  The antagonists try to frame the argument illogically, not being well versed in the logical fallacy Karl Popper defined as the falsification principle, aka the "Black Swan" problem.  Just because you have never seen a black swan, that does not mean they don't exist. Apologists like to coin this logical frame as "a lack of evidence is not evidence of lack".   The falsification principle defines where the burden of proof lies.  Antagonists try to switch the frame using anachronistic arguments about horses or steel or (insert anachronism here).

The Book of Mormon as a thing exists.  If you want to take an antagonist view, you have to demonstrate where and how it came about.  Joseph Smith offered one explanation, the burden of proof is to offer a counter-explanation.
