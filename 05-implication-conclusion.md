## Implications 

Being raised in the Mormon tradition, it is very difficult to challenge one's own internal belief system.  For me personally, the mathematics is undeniable.  But what are the consequences?  



### Personal reflections in the limit 
Again, I think about the consequences also in a maths frame.  What is the finite state of the system?  I experience cognitive dissonance, I realize my internal belief system is flawed.  So what do I do?  I could spend the rest of my life feeding the flames of real feelings of perceived betrayal.  Where does that road lead?  What is the finite state of that choice?  Living an angry, bitter life.  No, thank you.

So a mathematician will extend and abstract the consequences before settling on a finite state machine.  
- The Mormon Church institution manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Once you get on that train, the conclusions are obvious:  
- The Christian institution formalized by Constantine and reformed ever since has manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  
- The Masoretic tradition of Jewish thought manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Now consider the four domains of life: physical (health), education, religion, government/economics as defined by Luke 2:52.  In each domain, institutions manipulate information for their survival and growth.  Herein, I focus on just the religious dimension and its overflow into the other three domains.  

### Institutional layering
Once you conclude that institutions manage information for Ciceran purposes (grow and self-preserve), layering of belief needs to be deconstructed and redeveloped:  my Mormon traditions, the underlying Judeo-Christian traditions, and the underlying American-British-Roman traditions.  Nephi was wise when he observes how the "traditions of the fathers" can easily blind us.

### Anchor and Pivot: Freedom
If an apologist is going to emphasize the 33-year life paradigm, why is the 3-days of darkness paradigm also not taken literally?  Tomato. Potato.

Certainly, this cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable.  And stages of grief and anger may be natural.  But if you carefully reflect on the findings and implications:  you are now free.  Unchained.  Unfettered.  Unencumbered.  You can anchor to the significance of the Ancient American Record and shed the baggage of the translation process.  As one humble servant of the Brigham synod emphasized:  learn from the past, live in the present, prepare for the future.

#### Bothersome "translation" elements
Certain phrases in the Book of Mormon always bothered me.  Now, I am at peace.  They are bothersome because they represented Sidney's world view, or was erroneously grafted by Oliver.  I can now move forward.  But in the process, I have learned a bit of ancient Egyptian/Hebrew, so my understanding of their communication style and literary structures are more developed than they were two years ago.  Or four years ago.  Or five years ago, when they were practically non-existant.

- Adam fell that men may be.  Is this the fall of Adam, then why is Eve being blamed?  Is the entire devil narrative a speculation or prophecy?  Such speculation does make one carefully consider that the war in heaven was between a male (dragon) and a female (woman trying to birth a child) who was protected by a male (Michael) and a crown of 10 stars (or 12).  So maybe the battle for middle earth as part of the war in heaven is indeed gender related.
- A natural man is an enemy to God.  This sounds like 'original sin' masked by evangelicalism.  A worldview that aligns with the philosophy of John Locke.  However, everything I have read from the Egyptian is about valuing the goodness of life from conception.  The joy of marital congress, the gift-giving at birth, and the hope that all will pass the judgment to return to the celestial.  Such a worldview is closer to the Hobbes/Rousseau belief that man is naturally good until society corrupts him.
- Fools mock.  Since there is another layer of translation (either Mosiah/Benjamin of Ether's language), this phrase seems to be have a very profound message that got muddled in the 'telephone game.'  In the Old Testament we are informed that Elijah 'mocked' the priests of Baal.  Maybe it is true, that once you mock the ignorant, you will suffer consequences (that is, mourn).  So if you value this terrestial life, maybe such consequences make you a fool.  As I reflect on the Messianic life, it would seem that direct opposition to societal norms was part of the Messianic teachings.  Certainly, someone that valued the terrestial life would consider such boldness as unwise or not prudent (foolish), and would lead to certain suffering (and mouring).  Maybe a profound insight is masked behind what is currently available.
- Weak things strong.  Similar to above, there seems to be a profound teaching that has become distorted.  Should not one anchor to strengths to naturally develop weaknesses?  Human Performance Theory does emphasize that weaknesses have a higher PIP (potential in improvement), but one anchors to natural gifts/strengths and tries to expand from those anchors to acquire additional light and knowledge, learning and experience.   Isaiah was given a gift from God, a quick tongue.  Likely his entire life leveraged this strength as an anchor to perform other tasks, 'to make weak things strong'.  That is line upon line.  Given that 'to make' is an important meaning of the [z], I look forward to understanding the word play that apparently go lost in translation.

#### Mixture hypothesis creates options for reconstruction

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript and its editorialization.  

Was it a teaching tool used by Nephi that "Shazer" unlocked?  Or was it an intentional edit?  As I move forward with trying to understand the Ancient Religion, I have to maintain a consideration for both possibilities.  Having such options is both liberating and enabling.  I now can 'stand in the place of possibility' without anything pinning me down to a specific perspective.  Without such hindrances, the anticipated future is more refreshing.

#### Anchor of Faith: 3 days of darkness 
The anchor remains:  3 Nephi says there was 3 days of darkness whereas Christian tradition defines only 3 hours of darkness.  Certainly Sidney would have known the 3-hour tradition yet the 3-day innovation was included.  Maybe this was something Sidney edited, Oliver implemented, and Joseph Smith corrected.  Those details would be fascinating.

Regardless, why did the polemics of the Mormon movement NOT anchor to this obvious difference?  Why was faith not exercised in the literal words of 3 Nephi.  3 days of darkness!  And for the modern Mormon institution, what I describe as the Brigham Synod (the culture of my upbringing), where is the strong stance on this very obvious distinction?  Why is the difference avoided or apologized away?  Talk about the ultimate "click-bait" for a modern discussion:  Mormon Church doubles down on 3 Nephi description of three-days of darkness calling Western traditions of Roman history pure fiction!

Sadly, the Mormon Church has lost its backbone, or possibly never had one.  Institutional norms lead to mediocrity which is the antithesis of innovation.  To paraphrase the teaching in Revelation, the hot/cold is no more and everything is normative and lukewarm. 

This was the anchor of faith from which Mormonism could have thrived to fulfill the promise of Isaiah:  that the knowledge of Jehovah would fill the world like the waters fill the sea.  Apologists seem to want to make this data point disappear rather than anchor and pivot from it.  If Roman tradition says there was 3 hours of darkness and Nephi tradition says there was 3 days of darkness, who should you believe?  An uninvolved witness half way around the world, or a society directly involved with the Messiah Death Event?

### Logic from the darkness

Aha!  Can you see?

The logical conclusion is obvious.  If there really was an event that caused 3 days of darkness, and the Romans recrafted the story to be merely 3 hours of darkness, the implication is that the Messiah Death Event was very different than what the Romans said it was.

#### Volcanic Potential
What can cause 3 days of darkness throughout the world?  The answer is obvious: multiple volcanic eruptions that filled the skies with ash.  I would estimate at least 3 volcanoes erupted about the same time: geologists put Three Sisters (Oregon), Mt. Vesuvius (Pompeii), and one in Central America in an appropriate timeframe.  When an eruption occurs for a typical volcano, the first 3-5 days are typically matched with earthquakes and a plume of ash that can darken the sun.  

Early in Joseph Smith's life, he experienced the repercussions of a significant volcanic eruption half-way around the world.  On 5 April 1815, Mount Tambora first erupted.  By the next day, ash began falling on East Java hundreds of miles away.  Earthquakes and loud detonation noises were heard for days.  On 10 April 1815, things got worse.  Three plumes merged into one, some of the ash contained stones that were 8 inches in diameter.  A tsunami formed.  All vegetation on the island was completely annihilated.  The plume filled the upper atmosphere, blocking the sun, lower the planet's temperature in the northern hemisphere by 1 degree Fahrenheit and lead to the following year (1816) being classified as a Year without a Summer.


#### Airburst Potential
An airburst occurs when a meteor or comet enters the atmosphere and explodes before hitting the earth.  This event will create shockwaves that will shake the earth and may also generate tsunamis if near large bodies of water.  The Tungaska-event in Russia occurred in 1908.  Eyewitnesses described in detail the explosions, strange blue lights in the sky and an inability to light fires.  The explosion is estimated to be 100 to 2000 times more powerful that the bombing of Nagasaki/Hiroshima by the United States on 6 August 1945.  

Archaelogists have demonstrated that a similar airburst event occurred in Tall el-Hammam around the time of the Abrahamic tradition of the destruction of Sodom/Gomorrah (1650 BC or earlier).  Another airburst event occurred before 400 AD in the Ohio region of America, with an epicenter east of Cincinnati at what has been labeled the Turner earthworks.  And careful analysis of data from the Dead Sea suggests that another airburst event occurred directly over Jerusalem in the year 31 AD which registered as an earthquake in one study, the water-levels of the Dead Sea falling 50 feet immediately in another study, and unique pollen disturbances in a third study.  Although these latter two examples have not been fully identified as airburst events, the high temperatures, fires, and consequences are well documented.  Isaiah describes this apocalyptic event in association with the Messiah Death Event which includes the idea that a burning of the House of Jacob would leave no one alive (unless they were the poor hiding in the catacombs underground) and the heat turned the altar of the temple to chalkstone (chapters 20-24 is a good start).

#### Roman narratives
Pontius Pilate was installed as overseer of the region of Jerusalem approximately 26 AD.  Tiberius, emperor of Rome had coins minted celebrating his rule between 27-30 AD.  Around 26 AD, he seemed to retreat from Rome to the island of Capri.  His last official act as emperor was performed in 31 AD.  We are told he died of old-age in 37 AD on the island of Capri.

To honor Tiberius, Herod Antipas built a city in his honor in 20 AD along the shores of Galilee.  We have no knowledge if the emperor ever visited any of these territories.  Antipas only had a portion of control that his father King Herod maintained.  That is, Antipas was ruler of the region of Galilee and Perea (east of the Dead Sea).  He had no authority in Jerusalem.  Antipas had no authority over Judea only Galilee.   

Caligula's brother Nero is reported to have died in 31 AD.  Caligula had a strange fascination with early-Christian concepts such as the "Nicolaitan feast".  

Was Tiberius and Nero in Jerusalem for the Passover of 31 AD?  It is possible that the spectacle of the Messianic Jew was worth seeing in person?  Was this father-son pair (adoptive relationship) the fulfillment of a pagan entering the holy of holies and declaring "I am your God" (the classic anti-Christ narrative)?  We are supposed to believe that Paul presented himself before a king?  And how many stories do we have in the Book of Mormon about believers proselyting to kings?  Yet, we are to believe the Messiah incarnate did not.  Of course, if you are Rome, and something bad happens, a PR tactic would be to downplay any such possibility:  'maybe include the Messiah met with Pontius, an important Roman, but certainly not the leader of all of Rome.'  

Now, take a step back.  What do we know exactly about Roman history from 30 AD to about 500 AD?  Little is mentioned again about Jerusalem until after the appearance of Lyra Comet 1P in 66 AD.  There is a succession crisis where four different rulers via for the title of emperor (69 AD).  There is a narrative about Roman soldiers recapturing areas in the Levant:  the city of Jerusalem and Masada, for example.  Shortly thereafter (~100 AD), two historians were commissioned to write a official narratives:  Josephus for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger for a Roman audience.  As time marches on, in an effort to strengthen and unify Rome, a mother-son pair (Helena-Constantine) adopt a Christian belief and institutionalize a monotheistic religion (~350 AD).  And in 476 AD, Rome has officially fallen.

#### Darkness or Not?
If you distill these realities, the obvious conclusion is that the Messiah Death Event was very significant.  Why would the polytheistic Roman society have a mother-son adopt such a minor monotheistic religion if there was not reason (data we do not currently have) to motivate such adoption?  Why else would the Masoretes manipulate the original Passover tradition and invent the golden calf narrative which was non-existent in the Greek Septuagint?  Interestingly, the best source document we have to unlock the truth about the Messiah Death Event is the Book of Mormon, with all of its editorializations.  Coupled with historical evidence from the first Colon-mbia interactions, the truth about the Messiah Death Event can begin to be redeveloped.  That is, locals in America were claiming they knew about this event and for their blasphemy of what they shared, the Spanish would hang and burn them.  What exactly were they saying happened?

So were there 3 days of darkness or not?  Given the editorialization, maybe it was 5 days of darkness.  Or some other number.  Regardless, are you capable of anchoring your faith to this obvious data point and pivot?  The first implication is that Roman history is enthocentric fan-fiction that seemingly was an attempt to recover from catastrophe.  Something they attempted which seemed to fail miserably.  
- Imagine the Emperor was in Jerusalem with Caligula's brother Nero.  And a tortuous event was displayed for the world to see.  Very bad.  
- So bad that when "he" died a thousand Roman soldiers abandoned their posts.  And when "she" died (to his right), ten thousand Roman soldiers abandoned their posts.  
- And Tiberius/Nero are mocking and blaspheming the temple and Jewish traditions with these tortures.  What would happen?  
- Anger and revolt would lead to the death of the emperor and son.
- The Roman soldiers still active would die.  Those inactive (who abandoned their posts) would flee for their lives (penalty of abandonment may be death).  
- Reinforcements from a nearby garrison (Capernaum, part of the territories ruled by Herod Antipas) would take a few days to arrive.  
- Those tearing the "eagles down" from the entrance of the temple would prepare to defend the city.  
- Those that understood the spiritual significance of the event would gather any documents/records they could recover and retreat to the catacombs of the city where the poor dwelt (the lepers) or flee to the caves of Qumran.  They understand the prophecies and know that destruction is imminent.  
- Meanwhile the "he/she" pair that was tortured in such a blasphemous way are forgotten, thrown down onto the streets, two bovines caught in a net.  Maybe the 'poor in spirit' eventually moved them to a tomb.  Or maybe they stayed in the streets until the heavens retrieved them.
- And in a few days, Roman reinforcements arrive.  And the onslaught of violence begins.  But does not last long.  
- A bright light appears in the sky.  An airburst explosion.  A thousand times more powerful than the nuclear bombs that decimated Japanese cities.  Killed everyone.  As far away as the wadi near An-Nekhel.  And the House of Jacob with all of its branches were thrown into the fire.  
- And only the poor (e.g., the lepers in the catacombs under the city) or the poor in spirit (those that understood what was about to happen who fled to caves in Qumran) survived.  
- And a new House of Jacob was established with Jacob (not James) as the leader.  

As has been said, great are the words of Isaiah.  Indeed!

Many modern Christians are waiting for apocalypse now.  It already happened!  A careful reading of Isaiah (20-24), Psalms (20-24), and Matthew (20-24) will help clarify this reality.

### Messianic Conclusion 
This unlocks the obvious conclusion that the Romans intentionally lied about the details of the Messiah Death Event, which, in turn, will challenge any detail in Roman history after Julius Caesar:  when did the Pompeii destruction occur?  When and how did Tiberius and Nero die?

The Messiah Death Event was much worse than you can imagine.  More brutal for those tortured AND the Apocalyptic Celestial Response *was* Epic.  There are plenty of clues remaining to this reality, a trinity of triangulating testimonies:  Psalms (20-24), Isaiah (20-24), and Matthew (20-24).  

Rome does not recover to take the city of Jerusalem until 70 AD (soldiers die, difficult to recruit after the 'bad news' spreads, power structures are destabilized), Roman "historians" begin recrafting a narrative in 100 AD:  Josephus to develop messaging for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger to develop messaging for a Roman audience.

The death likely occurred on 5 May 31 AD.  There was a solar eclipse over the Japan Sea on that day; the Emperor of China observed the occurence, proclaimed a "the sun hides its face in shame as a son of the heavens has died" and entered his palace [in mourning] for 5 days.  First, according to this record, there is a reference of no sunlight.  Was it merely the solar eclipse or does this observation by the emperor of China include a testimony of 5 days of darkness.

An how would the Emperor know that the disasters were anchored to the death of a good man from heaven?  Was he (or one of his emissaries) one of the wisemen that directly had the opportunity to observe a Messianic life?  Were these wisemen later framed as "apostles" who were sent back home (sent away) to share the Messianic story?  Not to witness the death and destruction, but to share a way of living.

There was an airburst event over Jerusalem that turned stones on the temple's altar to chalkstone.  This event likely created shockwaves that archaelogists associate with a magnitude 6+ earthquake with an epicenter in the middle of the Dead Sea.  The water level of the Dead Sea immediately dropped 50 feet.  Lilies of the field were decimated according to pollen data replaced by flora that can survive in a more arid environment.  Hearty oliveyards and vineyards suffer and rebound.  Trees that trigger seeding after fire-events (pines and pistachios) flourish.  And so on.  

### Revisiting Book of Mormon logic 

If the Book of Mormon is literally true, why has the Mormon Church never double-downed on the distinction of 3 days NOT 3 hours? 

During the era of Joseph Smith, such an anchor may have not even been considered because: (1) it was new content that was just being read and processed, (2) although the editors may have debated the question of 3 days vs 3 hours, a consensus was never reached, (3) given Oliver's job as executive secretary to graft two drafts (at time competing) maybe this was just classified as an error, (4) everyone understood the translation was imperfect so such an anchor may be built on a foundation of sand.

But what of the modern movement?  Does it also have knowledge that such a distinction (3 days, not 3 hours) may have been an editorialization?  

#### Time and Season Under Heaven:  Non-optimal diffusion
For many devout Christians, there are significant hurdles to accept that the Roman version of events were not completely accurate.  Many evangelicals have a strong belief in the 'inerrancy of the Bible.'  Any issues with editorial manipulations of translators is a challenge for them.  As I remind them, using the evangelical frame:  'God is still on the throne.  God has got this!'  Said differently, these 'errors' are breadcrumbs or clues that enable us to move forward with faith.  To anchor, and pivot.

For many devout Mormons, there are similar hurdles.  'Inerrancy of the Book of Mormon' leaves behind clues.  And is not the glory of God to seek truth and light from the darkness? 

##### Pauline Gospel
Most of what we call the New Testament has been identified as Pauline writing by academic scholars.  The Epistle of Jacob (not James) is one exception.  And it would seem, that Revelation was significantly editorialized from an older record before Pauline influence.  Paul was born in Tarsus.  Tarsus is likely just outside of the blast zone that occurred on 5 May 31 AD which Paul may have observed when he was about 26-years old.

Paul was supposedly both a Roman citizen and a Pharisee.  This is difficult to believe given that his inability to understand [Habakkuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCshIENR8xw) led to the creation of his own gospel, the gospel of salvation by grace alone throught the Messianic blood.

Paul may have been a curator of information, gathering information from witnesses regarding the destruction that occurred and was associated with the Messiah.  Maybe he initially was collecting these witnessed accounts and then killing the witnesses (e.g., Stephen the Martyr).  And maybe a celestial visitation altered his course.  That is, Paul began to curate, synthesis, and write a coherent story in Greek, the language he knew well.  By about 50 AD, Paul began writing.  After Lyra Comet 1P appears in 66 AD, it seems like Paul stops writing.  Maybe the appearance of this comet was an unwelcome reminder to Nero (Nero was the nephew of his maternal Uncle Nero) which led to Paul's death.  That is, 'a Roman Citizen with Jewish ties is disseminating information about the Messiah Death Event.  We need to suppress this information.  It is time to return to the region and retake control.'

Obviously, in a collapsing society, such information would be classified as very valuable if the Roman elite wanted to suppress it.  So in an effort to prevent diffusion, Rome enables rapid diffusion.  Now written in Greek, it can reach more people.  And the locals that had their own traditions thought such narratives were obtuse and inaccurate.  Jacob the Just (not James) in Jerusalem for example.  Or the gnostics in Egypt.  And over time, their knowledge stores fade into history and what remains are the translations of Paul into Greek.  Much later (325 AD), at the Council of Nicene, religious erudites have an easier time adopting all of these Greek translations.  Why?  Because they included Greek editorializations.  That is, they were more palpable to the ethics and worldviews of the Greeks.

##### Joseph Smith Gospel
Albeit distorted, the thread of Christianity in the Pauline form diffused and survived.  Next, consider the Joseph Smith movement.  Given one task "bring forth the Ancient American Record", Joseph asked for more and the heavens obliged:  'hey, can I start a Church like my Uncle Jason?'

And the granting of such a wish required additional "visitations of angels" specifically assigned to help Joseph grow a Church. At some point, Joseph seemingly had at least one encounter with [Paul](https://ensignpeakfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Joseph-Smith’s-Description-of-Paul-the-Apostle.pdf).  Joseph described him physically as being short with dark hair and dark eyes.  Joseph describe his voice as being nasally or whiny except when agitated, when it became a booming voice.  Now why would the erudite Paul get agitated trying to 'mansplain' to Joseph?  lol.

This interaction is important to understand the diffusion of the Mormon thread of Christianity.  What did Paul reveal?  What was the big trade secret for successful diffusion?  The fundamental objective would be for a primary thread of Mormonism to survive.  To do so, you need a critical mass, the more the better.  And the message needs to be massaged into a normative mantra that can easily be accepted and adopted:  the Messiah visits America!

Consider how many religions have come and gone.  Lost to time and history.  Yet Christianity in its degraded form remains.  And, thanks to some guidance/counsel from Paul, the Mormon movement with all of its intrigue, schism, and evolution, yet remains.  Maybe analagous to a tree producing strange fruit, yet the tree remains.  Ripe for a final grafting of truth.  One last effort to restore the tree before determining it to be without worth and burning it into oblivion.

##### God's got this
It is very difficult for institutions to change their ingrained norms.  Maybe impossible to change.  But what a great lesson for the children in heaven to watch and observe.  

- Look.  This group was given scripture which they cannonized to create religious institutions of men, mingling scripture with philosophies to gain power.  
- And now look.  Another group was given additional scripture to challenge the other group.  And yet, the result is the same:  institutional cannonization of norms.

Regardless of the actions (and agency) of those within these two groups (Christians and Mormons), the celestial is more than capable of succeeding.  In typical evangelical parlance "God's got this."  This also is enabling.  You can choose to embrace a path forward, exercising faith in the celestial.  Or you can hope that these institutions will save you.  If you are looking for specific actions, I would recommend reading Isaiah 1 and ask yourself "do you grind the face of the poor?"  Then, I would recommend studying the life of Nephi and ask yourself what a celestial ministry looks like:  
- Are you willing to enable others telestially first by making certain everyone has free access to food/clothes/shelter?
- Are you willing to integrate with others a society anchored in freedoms:  an economy of abundance (not scarcity),  a homeopathic health care system that respects the herbs God provides and does not attempt to play God, a government anchored in freedom and peace for all humans, and a society that allows for natural socialities to develop based on shared interests.
- Are you willing to prepare to meet/receive the celestial? Can you stand in the place of possibility and be open to what comes, not afraid if it does not align with what you were taught throughout your lifetime?

Maybe as we study what is more readily available to us (the life and ministry of Nephi), we will be able to unlock clues that will help us identify the details of the life and ministry of the Messiah.


#### Rebooting the concept of religious belief
Once you pull the thread, you cannot go back.  But why would you want to?  The cognitive dissonance will be a challenge, but the facts will illucidate.  Your Mormon belief system, your Judeo-Christian belief system, your American-British-Roman belief system, they all need a reboot.

- The polemics logic was:  if the Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith must have been called by God as a prophet, and the Church he initiated must be the ONE and ONLY TRUE and LIVING Church on the fact of ALL the EARTH.
- A polemics argument, which has no value in the long term, could be:  if there were 3 days of darkness, Roman history is a fabrication, and all of my Western/Judeo-Christian norms are based on a lie.  
- An updated logic that is more positive, forward thinking would be: the Book of Mormon contains details of an Ancient American Record, the triangulation of this record with other ancient records will enable us, triangulating scientific evidence to the mix will allow us to reconstruct the Messiah Death Event, enabling us to appreciate the Messianic life, reinvigorating our relationship to the celestial in an ALL-INCLUSIVE way.


And that, my dear reader, is the seed needed to move forward.  

- To transcend the reality that institutions manipulate you so they can thrive and grow:  in healthcare, in education, in religion, in government/economics/politics. 
- To reconstruct your understanding of the Messiah Death Event so you can understand a Messianic life.    
- To enable you to understand the purpose of this planet [mor-mon-ya] and your celestial heritage.  

To learn from the past, to live in the present, and to prepare for the impending and imminent future.

Godspeed.  Namaste.
