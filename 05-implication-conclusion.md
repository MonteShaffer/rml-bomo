## Implications 

Being raised in the Mormon tradition, it is very difficult to challenge one's own internal belief system.  For me personally, the mathematics is undeniable.  But what are the consequences?  



### Personal reflections in the limit 
Again, I think about the consequences also in a maths frame.  What is the finite state of the system?  I experience cognitive dissonance, I realize my internal belief system is flawed.  So what do I do?  I could spend the rest of my life feeding the flames of real feelings of perceived betrayal.  Where does that road lead?  What is the finite state of that choice?  Living an angry, bitter life.  No, thank you.

So a mathematician will extend and abstract the consequences before settling on a finite state machine.  
- The Mormon Church institution manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Once you get on that train, the conclusions are obvious:  
- The Christian institution formalized by Constantine and reformed ever since has manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  
- The Masoretic tradition of Jewish thought manipulated information to encourage you to arrive at a certain conclusion so the institution could survive and thrive.  

Now consider the four domains of life: physical (health), education, religion, government/economics as defined by Luke 2:52.  In each domain, institutions manipulate information for their survival and growth.  Herein, I focus on just the religious dimension and its overflow into the other three domains.  

### Institutional layering
Once you conclude that institutions manage information for Ciceran purposes (grow and self-preserve), layering of belief needs to be deconstructed and redeveloped:  my Mormon traditions, the underlying Judeo-Christian traditions, and the underlying American-British-Roman traditions.  Nephi was wise when he observes how the "traditions of the fathers" can easily blind us.

### Anchor and Pivot: Freedom
If an apologist is going to emphasize the 33-year life paradigm, why is the 3-days of darkness paradigm also not taken literally?  Tomato. Potato.

Certainly, this cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable.  And stages of grief and anger may be natural.  But if you carefully reflect on the findings and implications:  you are now free.  Unchained.  Unencumbered.  You can anchor to the significance of the Ancient American Record and shed the baggage of the translation process.  As one true servant emphasized:  learn from the past, live in the present, prepare for the future.

#### Bothersome "translation" elements
Certain phrases in the Book of Mormon always bothered me.  Now, I am at peace.  They are bothersome because they represented Sidney's world view, or was erroneously grafted by Oliver.  I can now move forward.  But in the process, I have learned a bit of ancient Egyptian/Hebrew, so my understanding of their communication style and literary structures are more developed than they were two years ago.  Or four years ago.  Or five years ago, when they were practically non-existant.

- Adam fell that men may be.  Is this the fall of Adam, then why is Eve being blamed?  Is the entire devil narrative a speculation or prophecy.  
- A natural man is an enemy to God.  This sounds like 'original sin' masked by evangelicalism.  Maybe John Locke is correct.  However, everything I have read from the Egyptian is about valuing the goodness of life from conception.  The joy of marital congress, the gift-giving at birth, and the hope that all will pass the judgment to return to the celestial.  The Hobbes/Rousseau belief that man is naturally good until society corrupts him.
- Fools mock.  Since there is another layer of translation (either Mosiah/Benjamin of Ether's language), this phrase seems to be have a very profound message that got muddled in the 'telephone game.'
- Weak things strong.  Similar to above, one should anchor to strengths to naturally develop weaknesses.  Human Performance Theory does emphasize that weaknesses have a higher PIP (potential in improvement), but one anchors to naturally gifts and strengths and tries to expand from those anchors to acquire additional light and knowledge, learning and experience.  This narrative is very top-down hierarchical, not anchored to incremental learning that is natural and not forced.  Fundamentally, the current form of the narrative is contrary to my concept of God.

#### Mixture hypothesis creates options for reconstruction

Interestingly, stars or celestial events are obvious ommissions in the 1 Nephi narrative of the family traveling in the Arabian peninsula. (Imagine yourself in the middle of the Empty Quarter at night, would the stars not be a primary observation?)  So why are stars never mentioned?  In my reflections, I consider that possibly Nephi used omission as a teaching tool (fill in the blank):  children we were traveling through the barren deserts of Arabia, what is missing in the story?  The stars, of course!  As I now have arrived at the artistic license of the editorial process, another possibility exists:  it was removed.  But why?  Maybe to address the problems associated with the lost manuscript and its editorialization.  

Was it a teaching tool used by Nephi that "Shazer" unlocked?  Or was it an intentional edit?  As I move forward with trying to understand the Ancient Religion, I have to maintain a consideration for both possibilities.  Having such options is both liberating and enabling.  I now can 'stand in the place of possibility' without anything pinning me down to a specific perspective.  Without such hindrances, the anticipated future is more refreshing.

#### Anchor of Faith: 3 days of darkness 
The anchor remains:  3 Nephi says there was 3 days of darkness whereas Christian tradition defines only 3 hours of darkness.  Certainly Sidney would have known the 3-hour tradition yet the 3-day innovation was included.  Maybe this was something Sidney edited, Oliver implemented, and Joseph Smith corrected.  Those details would be fascinating.

Regardless, why did the polemics of the Mormon movement NOT anchor to this obvious difference?  Why was faith not exercised in the literal words of 3 Nephi.  3 days of darkness!  And for the modern Mormon institution, what I describe as the Brigham Synod (the culture of my upbringing), where is the strong stance on this very obvious distinction?  Why is the difference avoided or apologized away?  Talk about the ultimate "click-bait" for a modern discussion:  Mormon Church doubles down on 3 Nephi description of three-days of darkness calling Western traditions of Roman history pure fiction! 

This was the anchor of faith from which Mormonism could have thrived to fulfill the promise of Isaiah:  that the knowledge of Jehovah would fill the world like the waters fill the sea.  Apologists seem to want to make this data point disappear rather than anchor and pivot from it.  If Roman tradition says there was 3 hours of darkness and Nephi tradition says there was 3 days of darkness, who should you believe?  An uninvolved witness half way around the world, or a society directly involved with the Messiah Death Event?

### Logic from the darkness

Aha!  Can you see?

The logical conclusion is obvious.  If there really was an event that caused 3 days of darkness, and the Romans recrafted the story to be merely 3 hours of darkness, the implication is that the Messiah Death Event was very different than what the Romans said it was.

#### Volcanic Potential
What can cause 3 days of darkness throughout the world?  The answer is obvious: multiple volcanic eruptions that filled the skies with ash.  I would estimate at least 3 volcanoes erupted about the same time: geologists put Three Sisters (Oregon), Mt. Vesuvius (Pompeii), and one in Central America in an appropriate timeframe.  When an eruption occurs for a typical volcano, the first 3-5 days are typically matched with earthquakes and a plume of ash that can darken the sun.  

Early in Joseph Smith's life, he experienced the repercussions of a significant volcanic eruption half-way around the world.  On 5 April 1815, the first eruption occured.  By the next day, ash began falling on East Java hundreds of miles away.  Earthquakes and loud detonation noises were heard for days.  On 10 April 1815, things got worse.  Three plumes merged into one, some of the ash contained stones that were 8 inches in diameter.  A tsunami formed.  All vegetation on the island was completely annihilated.  The plume filled the upper atmosphere, blocking the sun, lower the planet's temperature in the northern hemisphere by 1 degree Fahrenheit and lead to the following year (1816) being classified as a Year without a Summer.


#### Airburst Potential
An airburst occurs when a meteor or comet enters the atmosphere and explodes before hitting the earth.  This event will create shockwaves that will shake the earth and may also generate tsunamis if near large bodies of water.  The Tungaska-event in Russia occurred in 1908.  Eyewitnesses described in detail the explosions, strange blue lights in the sky and an inability to light fires.  The event is estimated to be 100 to 2000 times more devastating that the bombing of Nagasaki/Hiroshima by the United States on 6 August 1945.  

Archaelogists have demonstrated that a similar airburst event occurred in Tall el-Hammam around the time of the Abrahamic tradition of the destruction of Sodom/Gomorrah (1650 BC or earlier).  Another airburst event occurred before 400 AD in the Ohio region of America, with an epicenter east of Cincinnati at what has been labeled the Turner earthworks.  And careful analysis of data from the Dead Sea suggests that another airburst event occurred directly over Jerusalem in the year 31 AD which registered as an earthquake in one study, the water-levels of the Dead Sea falling 50 feet immediately in another study, and unqiue pollen disturbances in a third study.  Although these latter two examples have not been fully identified as airburst events, the high temperatures, fires, and consequences are well documented.  Isaiah describes this apocalyptic event in association with the Messiah Death Event which includes the idea that a burning of the House of Jacob would leave no one alive (unless they were the poor hiding in the catacombs underground) and the heat turned the altar of the temple to chalkstone (chapters 20-24 is a good start).

#### Roman narratives
Pontius Pilate was installed as overseer of the region of Jerusalem approximately 26 AD.  Tiberius, emperor of Rome had coins minted celebrating his rule between 27-30 AD.  Around 26 AD, he seemed to retreat from Rome to the island of Capri.  His last official act as emperor was performed in 31 AD.  We are told he died of old-age in 37 AD on the island of Capri.

To honor Tiberius, Herod Antipas built a city in his honor in 20 AD along the shores of Galilee.  Antipas only had a portion of control that his father King Herod maintained.  That is, Antipas was ruler of the region of Galilee and Perea (east of the Dead Sea).  He had no authority in Jerusalem.  We have no knowledge if the emperor ever visited any of these territories.

Caligula's brother Nero is reported to have died in 31 AD.  Caligula had a strange fascination with early-Christian concepts such as the "Nicolaitan feast".  

Was Tiberius and Nero in Jerusalem for the Passover of 31 AD?  It is possible that the spectacle of the Messianic Jew was worth seeing in person?  Was this father-son pair (adoptive relationship) the fulfillment of a pagan entering the holy of holies and declaring "I am your God" (the classic anti-Christ narrative)?

Now, take a step back.  What do we know exactly about Roman history from 30 AD to about 500 AD?  Little is mentioned again about Jerusalem until after the appearance of Lyra Comet 1P in 66 AD.  There is a succession crisis where four different rulers via for the title of emperor (69 AD).  There is a narrative about Roman soldiers recapturing areas in the Levant:  the city of Jerusalem and Masada, for example.  Shortly thereafter (~100 AD), two historians were commissioned to write a official narratives:  Josephus for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger for a Roman audience.  As time marches on, in an effort to strengthen and unify Rome, a mother-son pair (Helena-Constantine) adopt a Christian belief and institutionalize a monotheistic religion (~350 AD).  And in 476 AD, Rome has officially fallen.

#### Darkness or Not?
If you distill these realities, the obvious conclusion is that the Messiah Death Event was very significant.  Why would the polytheistic Roman society have a mother-son adopt such a minor monotheistic religion if there was not reason (data we do not currently have) to motivate such adoption?  Why else would the Masoretes manipulate the original Passover tradition and invent the golden calf narrative which was non-existent in the Greek Septuagint?  Interestingly, the best source document we have to unlock the truth about the Messiah Death Event is the Book of Mormon, with all of its editorial editions and flaws.  Coupled with historical evidence from the first Colon-mbia interactions, the truth about the Messiah Death Event can begin to be redeveloped.  That is, locals were claiming they knew about this event and for their blasphemy of what they shared, the Spanish would hang and burn them.  What exactly were they saying happened?

So were there 3 days of darkness or not?  Given the editorialization, maybe it was 5 days of darkness.  Or some other number.  Regardless, will you anchor your faith in this data point and pivot?  The first implication is that Roman history is enthocentric fan-fiction that seemingly was an attempt to recover from catastrophe.  Something they attempted which seemed to fail miserably.  Imagine the Emperor was in Jerusalem with Caligula's brother Nero.  And a tortuous event was displayed for the world to see.  Very bad.  So bad that when "he" died a thousand Roman soldiers abandoned their posts.  And when "she" died, ten thousand Roman soldiers abandoned their posts.  And Tiberius/Nero are mocking and blaspheming the temple and Jewish traditions.  What would happen?  Anger and revolt would lead to the death of the emperor and son.  The Roman soldiers still active would die.  Those inactive (who abandoned their posts) would flee for their lives (penalty of abandonment may be death).  Reinforcements from a nearby garrison (Capernaum, part of the territories ruled by Herod Antipas) would take a few days to arrive.  Those tearing the "eagles down" from the entrance of the temple would prepare to defend the city.  Those that understood the spiritual significance of the event would  gather any documents/records they could recover and retreat to the catacombs of the city where the poor dwelt (the lepers) or flee to the caves of Qumran.  They understand the prophecies and know that destruction is imminent.  Meanwhile the "he/she" pair that was tortured in such a blasphemous way are forgotten thrown down onto the streets, two bovines caught in a net.  And in a few days, Roman reinforcements arrive.  And the onslaught of violence begins.  But does not last long.  A bright light appears in the sky.  An airburst explosion.  A thousand times more powerful than the nuclear bombs that decimated Japan's city and killed thousands.  Killed everyone.  As far away as the wadi near An-Nekhel.  And the House of Jacob with all of its branches were thrown into the fire.  And only the poor (e.g., the lepers in the catacombs under the city) or the poor in spirit (those that understood what was about to happen who fled to Qumran) survived.  And a new House of Jacob was established with Jacob (not James) as the leader.  As has been said, great are the words of Isaiah.  Indeed!

Many modern Christians are waiting for apocalypse now.  It already happened!  A careful reading of Isaiah (20-24), Psalms (20-24), and Matthew (20-24) will help clarify this reality.

### Messianic Conclusion 
This unlocks the obvious conclusion that the Romans intentionally lied about the details of the Messiah Death Event, which, in turn, will challenge any detail in Roman history after Julius Caesar:  when did the Pompeii destruction occur?  When and how did Tiberius and Nero die?

The Messiah Death Event was much worse than you can imagine.  More brutal for those tortured AND the Apocalyptic Celestial Response *was* Epic.  There are plenty of clues remaining to this reality, a trinity of triangulating testimonies:  Psalms (20-24), Isaiah (20-24), and Matthew (20-24).  

Rome does not recover to take the city of Jerusalem until 70 AD (soldiers die, difficult to recruit after the bad news spreads, power structures are destabilized), Roman "historians" begin recrafting a narrative in 100 AD:  Josephus to develop messaging for the Jewish audience and Pliny the Younger to develop messaging for a Roman audience.

The death likely occurred on 5 May 31 AD.  There was a solar eclipse over the Japan Sea on that day; the Emperor of China observed the occurence, proclaimed a "Son of the heavens has died" and entered his palace [in mourning] for 5 days.  How would he know?  Was he (or one of his emissaries) one of the wisemen that directly had the opportunity to observe a Messianic life?  Were these wisemen later framed as "apostles" who were sent back home (sent away) to share the Messianic story.  Not to witness the death and destruction, but to share a way of living.

There was an airburst event over Jerusalem that turned stones on the temple's altar to chalkstone.  This event likely created shockwaves that archaelogists associate with a magnitude 6+ earthquake with an epicenter in the middle of the Dead Sea.  The water level of the Dead Sea immediately dropped 50 feet.  Lilies of the field were decimated according to pollen data replaced by flora that can survive in a more arid environment.  Hearty oliveyards and vineyards suffer and rebound.  Trees that trigger seeding after fire-events (pines and pistachios) flourish.  And so on.  

### Revisiting Book of Mormon logic 

If the Book of Mormon is literally true, why has the Mormon Church never double-downed on the distinction of 3 days NOT 3 hours? 

During the era of Joseph Smith, such an anchor may have not even been considered because: (1) it was new content that was just being read and processed, (2) although the editors may have debated the question of 3 days vs 3 hours, a consensus was never reached, (3) given Oliver's job as executive secretary to graft two drafts (at time competing) maybe this was just classified as an error, (4) everyone understood the translation was imperfect so such an anchor may be built on a foundation of sand.

But what of the modern movement?  Does it also have knowledge that such a distinction (3 days, not 3 hours) may have been an editorialization?  Regardless, stepping forward with faith that the 3 days of darknesses was not edited by Oliver or Sidney, the implications are tremendous.  

Once you pull the thread, you cannot go back.  But why would you want to?  The cognitive dissonance will be a challenge, but the facts will illucidate.  Your Mormon belief system, your Judeo-Christian belief system, your American-British-Roman belief system, they all need a reboot.

- The polemics logic was:  if the Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith must have been called by God as a prophet, and the Church he initiated must be the ONE and ONLY TRUE and LIVING Church on the fact of ALL the EARTH.
- A polemics argument, which has no value in the long term, could be:  if there were 3 days of darkness, Roman history is a fabrication, and all of my Western/Judeo-Christian norms are based on a lie.  
- An updated logic that is more positive, forward thinking would be: the Book of Mormon contains details of an Ancient American Record, the triangulation of this record with other ancient records will enable us, triangulating scientific evidence to the mix will allow us to reconstruct the Messiah Death Event, enabling us to appreciate the Messianic life, reinvigorating our relationship to the celestial in an ALL-INCLUSIVE way.


And that, my dear reader, is the seed needed to move forward.  

- To transcend the reality that instutitions manipulate you so they can thrive and grow:  in healthcare, in education, in religion, in government/economics/politics. 
- To reconstruct your understanding of the Messiah Death Event so you can understand a Messianic life.    
- To enable you to understand the purpose of this planet [mor-mon-ya] and your celestial heritage.  

To learn from the past, to live in the present, and to prepare for the impending and imminent future.

Godspeed.  Namaste.
