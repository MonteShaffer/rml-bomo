## Moses 
The story of Moses is the glue that binds Judeo-Christian traditions.

In order to appreciate the story, we have to layout the key principles of the event.  Words like "congeal" and "lead" and eagles-wings will inform our understanding of "dry land" to "as if dry land".  That is, let's dig into the Masoretic Hebrew and Septuagint Greek.

### Context
The event of the "crossing" occurred during the month of the passover (at inception) which would be very near the Aries Equinox, circa March 21, of the event year (much debate over that date, not important for the discussion regarding "what happened" exactly).  The location does matter for this discussion.  We will assume the Khar-Khar (Horeb) is a mountain of significance across the human story, a cross roads for Abraham, Moses, Nephi, Jesus, Mohammed (and others) and is located in the land of Midian (Arabia), specifically the tallest mountain in the region, the Mountain of Almonds (Jabal Al-Lawz).  That is, it is "the mountain of all mountains".  The crossing occurred at exactly 29 degrees north latitude (near Nuweiba which in ancient Egyptian may indicate the event "nu-uah-iba").

Today, [Nuweiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuweiba) has a minimum temperature of 50 degrees in January and about 57 degrees in March.  The sea (surface) temperature is about 72 degrees in January and 70 degrees in March.  The [bathometer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03765-8/figures/2) data for the Gulf of Aqaba shows a maximum depth of about 1000 meters at the crossing location.  At this depth, modern readings show a similar sea temperature of 70 degrees (at 700 meters at the observation location further north).  Although the [Levant](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282773661_The_climate_variability_in_northern_Levant_over_the_past_20000_years) has interesting temperature fluctuations over time, we will assume the modern temperature is similar to the "crossing" temperature.  The presence of rivers (wadis with flowing water) are also an interesting data point that should be considered.

- About March 21
- At 29 degrees north latitude 
- Air temperature would have been about 57 degrees and sea temperature would have been about 70 degrees.

### Biblical Context 
The story is concise in the Old Testament yet Isaiah and the Psalmist provide additional anchors for insight.

#### heap 
Ex 15:8 (comparison to Jos 3:13/3:16 when the Jordan river was also crossed - BetaBara)
Psa 33:7 references the depth of the sea is heaped into "storehouses" - cylindric form?
?Hab 3:8-15 walk "through the sea" through the heap of great water - God also had horses and chariots?

#### dry ground 
Ex 14:16 How do you go on dry ground "in the midst" of the sea?  Read the Hebrew.  It seems to imply "as-if" dry ground.  The House of Jacob walked over the congealed water like you would step over a cadaver in the street (Isaiah 50/52) whereas the Egyptians "sank like lead"
Ex 14:21 strong east will all night, making the sea "as-if" dry land ... the waters were "divided": [H1234](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1234/kjv/wlc/0-1/) suggests the water beein cleaved open, ripped open, "as if" cut be the staff
Ex 14:22 "midst" [tavek](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8432/kjv/wlc/0-1/) implies the middle - was all of the water removed and they had to descend 1000 meters as they crossed, OR was the surface of the water removed and the congealed "deep waters" were slushy/icy for them to meander across.  This is a large difference in volume of water needing to be displaced, and God is Almighty, but Almighty also implies efficient.
Moses commands with his staff/rod (as opposed to Aaron's rod/staff) and in Nephi we get the addition "Moses spoke" (abracadabra?)
