## Moses 
The story of Moses is the glue that binds Judeo-Christian traditions.

In order to appreciate the story, we have to layout the key principles of the event.  Words like "congeal" and "lead" and eagles-wings will inform our understanding of "dry land" to "as if dry land".  That is, let's dig into the Masoretic Hebrew and Septuagint Greek.

### Context
The event of the "crossing" occurred during the month of the passover (at inception) which would be very near the Aries Equinox, circa March 21, of the event year (much debate over that date, not important for the discussion regarding "what happened" exactly).  The location does matter for this discussion.  We will assume the Khar-Khar (Horeb) is a mountain of significance across the human story, a cross roads for Abraham, Moses, Nephi, Jesus, Mohammed (and others) and is located in the land of Midian (Arabia), specifically the tallest mountain in the region, the Mountain of Almonds (Jabal Al-Lawz).  That is, it is "the mountain of all mountains".  The crossing occurred at exactly 29 degrees north latitude (near Nuweiba which in ancient Egyptian may indicate the event "nu-uah-iba").

Today, [Nuweiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuweiba) has a minimum temperature of 50 degrees in January and about 57 degrees in March.  The sea (surface) temperature is about 72 degrees in January and 70 degrees in March.  The [bathometer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03765-8/figures/2) data for the Gulf of Aqaba shows a maximum depth of about 1000 meters at the crossing location.  At this depth, modern readings show a similar sea temperature of 70 degrees (at 700 meters at the observation location further north).  Although the [Levant](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282773661_The_climate_variability_in_northern_Levant_over_the_past_20000_years) has interesting temperature fluctuations over time, we will assume the modern temperature is similar to the "crossing" temperature.  The presence of rivers (wadis with flowing water) are also an interesting data point that should be considered.

- About March 21
- At 29 degrees north latitude 
- Air temperature would have been about 57 degrees and sea temperature would have been about 70 degrees.

### Biblical Context 
The story is concise in the Old Testament yet Isaiah and the Psalmist provide additional anchors for insight.

#### heap 
Ex 15:8 (comparison to Jos 3:13/3:16 when the Jordan river was also crossed - BetaBara)
Psa 33:7 references the depth of the sea is heaped into "storehouses" - cylindric form?
?Hab 3:8-15 walk "through the sea" through the heap of great water - God also had horses and chariots?

#### dry ground 
Ex 14:16 How do you go on dry ground "in the midst" of the sea?  Read the Hebrew.  It seems to imply "as-if" dry ground.  The House of Jacob walked over the congealed water like you would step over a cadaver in the street (Isaiah 50/52) whereas the Egyptians "sank like lead"
Ex 14:21 strong east will all night, making the sea "as-if" dry land ... the waters were "divided": [H1234](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1234/kjv/wlc/0-1/) suggests the water beein cleaved open, ripped open, "as if" cut be the staff
Ex 14:22 "midst" [tavek](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8432/kjv/wlc/0-1/) implies the middle - was all of the water removed and they had to descend 1000 meters as they crossed, OR was the surface of the water removed and the congealed "deep waters" were slushy/icy for them to meander across.  This is a large difference in volume of water needing to be displaced, and God is Almighty, but Almighty also implies efficient.
Moses commands with his staff/rod (as opposed to Aaron's rod/staff) and in Nephi we get the addition "Moses spoke" (abracadabra? - heard the cry Neh 9:9 and answered Isa 50:2)
"dry ground" in 14:22 has the "bayit" preposition that is translated as upon.
Ex 14:29, Ex 15:19, Neh 9:11 (stones), Psa 66:6 (went through the flood [stream/river] on foot - is it dry or "as-if dried)
Isa 50:2 dry up the sea, make the rivers a wilderness? (is this drought or the event?)

#### lead/feather 
Ex 15:1 The song of the crossing ... 15:5 they sank as stone 
Ex 15:10 They sank as lead when the sea covered them ... 
Ex 19:4 Did you not rejoice at what I did to the Egyptians when I bore you up on eagles-wings
Ex 15:12, the right hand (south) had the earth swallow them (mud? or water?)
Ex 15:16 Your people shall cross "as still as a stone" - does this suggest they are walking gently
[gal] as redeemed [ga'al] as a wave 

Ex 15:8 water streams gathered together and stood upright (like a heap/storehouse - mound or wave)
[tehom] depths were congealed [H7087](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7087/kjv/wlc/0-1/) in the heart of the sea ... how does water "thicken" or congeal" - slush? [qapha] can mean frozen water.  The deep became firm walls

#### divide 
Psa 74:13, was this H1234 a violent cutting or tearing, a memory of primordial times when the sea was dried and the dragons defeated?

#### rebuke [H1606]
Psa 18:15, 2 Sa 22:16 can his nostril breath be cold as in flash-freeze Frozo cold?
Psa 76:6
Isa 50:2, 51:20, 66:15 refers to a rebuke of fire ...



### Possible Explanation
Water needs to be cold to freeze, about 40 degrees fahrenheit for fresh water and lower temperatures for salt water.  All night, an "east wind was blowing" was this the wind of the cold ice dragon.  Once the water is cold enough, a flash freeze event can let you stack water like a slushy snow cone ... see the instant ice glitch [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zdghpZpNOwo)

Was this the same technology Jesus used to walk on water?

Notice, I respect the divine to use the rules of science in an extraordinary way.

Wind cools the water of the sea for 24 hours, when Moses speaks with his rod/staff, the water is "torn apart" and ice/slushy walls are formed (see YouTube example).  A constant wind would continue to create a wall of a slushy mountain minimizing the overall need for massive displacement.  The House of Jacob would be terrified as they crossed.  They understood ice I imagine, but this instant ice was delicate and fragile, as they walked like feathers on the surface whereas the Egyptians sank like a stone or lead ... if a pillar from heaven was creating this frozen-zone wind, the slush ice would be unstable and easily melt if temperature reduction is not being maintained - or better yet, the fire-column drops down where the Egyptians are crossing and immediately melts everything...

[abar] as [H5674](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5674/kjv/wlc/0-1/) is the go over, the crossing... stepping over the sea like one would step over a corpse... ever so carefully. For about 15 kilometers

### Take a stand of faith in the place of possibility
The Mormon church needs to stop be Babylon pleasers and stand as servants to nurture the vineyard one last time.  What a great anchor of faith.  Ani Nafi university could have a team explore the hydrology of such an event using the surface tension, capillary effects, and so on.  Could this flash-freeze slushee surface be a solution? 

It seems this is a geo-thermal technology.  One columns spews hot-fire the other column cold-cloud... a pillar of fire by night, a pillar of cloud by day to heat/cool as needed.  Two ends of a geothermal system, so when the fire pillar interfered with Egyptians, was the other side drawing heat from the Sea to heat the fire?  You could reverse the system to blast cold air in one place and exhaust hot air somewhere else.

Ron Wyatt was an extremist, but his ideas have merit.  So let's use science to test some hypotheses.  Send crews of divers to Nuweiba and look for actual artifacts.  Do soil samples, sea samples, wadi samples to understand the flora and fauna of this location.  God's ways are not our ways, but is not the purpose to work out his ways?  Life eternal to know God?

Ultimately, the keys to creation can be unlocked if we can find the Liahona and read it.  All of the gaps in science and technology will diminish, we will work out the last 4+ quantum particles to create a unified theory and address conundrums baffling us (wave-particle duality, Schrodinger's cat, Heisenberg's uncertainty, etc.)

What are the key drivers?
- Repent, read Isaiah 1 and Epistle of Jacob - focus efforts on a abundance economy with arg max/min to feed the world and house the world for free ... a land of milk and honey (wine and cheese) procured without money.  What seed capital is needed to get it launched?  What is required in terms of labor contributions to make it sustainable... Hemp crete and hemp insulation videos from yesterday (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLXXjvQXgI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5dcBqTpDeE&pp=0gcJCa0JAYcqIYzv).
- Search, the knowledge of Jehovah shall fill the world as waters fill the sea ... the best search would be for the Liahona.  However, concurrently, a search of ancient sites and an open-sharing paradigm, e.g., the anti-Smithsonian Institute (maybe call it the Joseph Smithsonian institute - he ruffled feathers with the group in his era).  Go bold, brand in opposition to Babylon.  Create a modular housing system and call it Apple in reference to Adam/Eve.  Modular, local, scalable.

We just need to set-seed(NULL) and let the rest take care of itself.  Ask the CIA idiots for an initial commitment of 100B each, and figure out ways to make everything efficient with high-quality results.  Focus on "Ancient American" reparations first - all the first nations.  Simultaneous focus on widows/fatherless (are not Native groups a good test-case of this).  The objective is simple:  how to feed, clothe, and house everyone on earth.  Using the best inputs (most abundant and sustainable):  water, hemp, trees, aluminum, steel, etc.  Lithium and rare earth minerals are not abundant, so they are poor choices.  Have geo-thermal systems for modular AC units (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-41UF02vrU).  Plumb the base 10 units for a walk-in fridge/freezer and figure out how to transfer heat to shower, capture rainwater, have a green house on south "corner" of each unit... helicopter or crane install.  Modular design in creation, scaling, installing.  Dirt boys move earth and prep the area on day 1, on day 2, homes are installed.  By day 10, we have move in?  Initial benchmarks.  Can we get it down to one 10-set start to finish from sunrise to sunset in one day.  10-set with basics, 12 of those formed with North as third dividers for train tech.  100 of those is a community: 10 x 12 = 120 x 100 = 12000 ... the hundred can be a bigger shape, lots of space for crops or cattle or whatever.

I can speculate and crude-design all I want, but without hands ... at some point, I need to be the armchair quarterback and call the shots... I am physically incapable of doing the work myself without the necessary support systems.  I am the Davidic guy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFcJ5uhEgTA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_iM-cNYJ4), Joseph Smith's prophesied final servant?  If so, I already know who my spokesman (Kevin) and staff (Alatini) are!

If you are called, you are called.  You don't seek the calling.  Stone cut out of the mountain, Monte from Montana.  My father's name is David.  The Mormon curse at my birth.  Bootstrap life with projects/opus-es completed.  Maybe.  But so what.  Rob Warcup has a few good ideas.  Latter-day Chad, not so much!  Follow JS example, learn Hebrew and Egyptian.  Then maybe you can say something intelligible. 

Fullness of gospel... (Love God [however you want to define it], love neighbor).

Repent - constantly change your mind 
Ritual bathing - ritual blessing 
Ritual endowments - we have one version of many potentials ... in one day give newcomers all of it... open the temple doors.

An Elder, but not a high priest... return to first elders  ... first/second/last (Kevin/Alatini/me)... JS failed because of money dimension.  Call people Zion = no poor (and therefore no rich) among them.

A church without creeds, purge the Sidney elements immediately.  Uchtdorf/Bednar/Kim B Clark are remnant, nothing more.

Go to war against Babylon, the great and spacious building (virtual Twitter echo-chambers).  Challenge "settled science" emphatically.  Separate data collection, analysis, and synthesis.  Focus less on synthesis into theories and more on data and its descriptives.

[smithsonian](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/search/search-results) ... they love their protections
Joseph Smithonian ... something ridiculous but obvious (maybe a SunStone that looks very similar/ mayan / old sunstone glyph or something) [Sun Clipart #55087](https://clipartix.com/sun-clipart-vector-pencil-and-in-color-sun-jpg-image-55087/) ... put Intellect Reserve lawyers to work...

Land ownership and cessation strategies ... actively have the constitution hang by a thread... re-acquire all Utah lands stolen by polygamy move of federales.  Go to court to challenge forgotten treaties to give the Ancient Americans their lands back.  Burn it down, to the ground, the remnants and ideas can remain but the Babylonian form will end...

JS bought Egyptian papyrus for his personal motives (Lehi's stuff) but God left it as a marker: study Hebrew, organize and find all things ancient Egyptian.  Create a repository, open-source.  Add artifacts that are directly tied to Paleo-Hebrew/Egyptian or directly tied to Ancient American history.  For example, the decalogue as possibly a pre-exilic king-line form of righting that got standardized during the exile.  Remember Josiah had women from Egypt and Babylon, maybe "exilic Hebrew" was already a thing being considered during his lifetime.  That would explain the decalogue coming from Mulek.  The literal translation would be nice.  Chase the rabbit into the hole.  The result may be "this is a hoax" but until I read the 10 commandments in the given language, how will I know.  If it is verbatim copy of Masoretic decalogue, of course it is a hoax.  But if not, the "diff" would be very insightful to understand the religion of Moses.

I tire of waiting, what more can I do with my current circumstances?  I feel like I need my moral-authority unchallenged, would that not be ET-my name is Enoch and I am here to put Monte in charge?  Short of that, I cannot see a path forward.  Truth from darkness.  Gird up loins.  Be divorced.  Be hidden/forgotten in plain site.  I learned some other foretold details.  But I already had to face that reality with Stone-from-Mountain.  Yes, I am learned.  And Yes, I will defend JS desire to share truth.  I will not defend his actions, but will celebrate them as clues and markers to truly understand the religion of Nephi.

No one cares... 6-8 views on my shorts about Nasca/lilies etc. No views on Easter May 5 of 2024.  20-24 (Isaiah, Matthew, Psalms).  No one cares!

Did I start my Karen journey.  Left in suspension for how long.  Cipher in the Snow for how long?  If something happens to unlock what feels like a standstill, the heavens better have recordings of my past thoughts, I won't be able to or want to repeat myself.

One of the Davidic scriptures suggested he was exhausted from his efforts to contribute to the world.  Yes, that is me to a T.

Suspension on which timeline, which path forward.  And honestly, more knowledge at this point will not help much, because no one cares.  And until I anchor and begin to iterate and pivot, the groundswell event has no meaning without it impacting others.  Great, I figured out some things!  No one cares!

I don't have the energy to debate or defend what I know.  I do have the energy to begin to guide a last effort to set-seed(NULL) for Zion.  Enoch are you arriving anytime soon?  How about by September 23!?!

You can't have a Most High God if you don't have gods (elohim ananazi ananoki).
You can't have an Eternal Father if there are not children (ergo an Eternal Mother - Queen Mother of Heaven).  The HG is a representation of She.  She is light and energy.  He is density and matter.

Pauline Christianity is so embedded in Rigdon's philosophy, unlocking true Christianity will take some time.  God is in you (Gospel of Thomas). saviors of men (vs Savior of Men).  The Legend of Nephi is essential to unlocking the true nature of Jesus.  Why just a Son of God?  Where is the Daughter of God?  Eve as the "savior" (lower case) for Adam [not helpmeet].

The answers will be in the languages.

Liahona is the ultimate prize.  The Easter Egg of Ready Player 1.  We need Expedition Unknown style entertainment.

What we need is process innovations.  Can you develop a soil sample kit and analysis like DNA 23 and me?  I order a kit, take a 1-10 meter soil sample, and process the results in days.  Data is kaggled for anyone to use, the descriptive data is ready to go.  Get old-timers out in the lakes collecting the data.  Reduce the time/costs of the pollen detections, etc.  Or OCR old texts and potential translations in a crowd-source methodology.  And so on... Lidar of large earth, lidar of small carvings in stone or wood.

Is set.seed(NULL) the same thing as the foundations for a STARTREK like society?

No one cares.

Will bad vision mean going fully blind?  Will that be the cost to pay "to fulfill all righteousness"?  Is this why I like to touch my son, a preparation for a time when I will not see him.  Setup a house with routine.  8 steps to sandals, 8 steps to bathroom, pee for an 8 count, three times, and so on.  At this moment I am practicing my computer skillz without my glasses (which is visage enough?)

The role of a modern Moses?  Moses created a government (Zion) and a school (Jerusalem): teachings to explain the social contract of government.

The government would be Star Trekkian.  We the people of planet ____Mormona____ in order to demostrate an understanding of the gift it is to live and interact with Great Earth Mother (Gaia), hereby declare the following:

This earth, a green-blue water world is a gift.  Not in the sense of ownership, but stewardship.  We were gifted the opportunity to descend here and learn from living here.  This garden temple was intended to be a house of healing to bring together varying celestial tribes so they may find peace and harmony.  That goal is unchanged.  This is the last iteration of that attempt.  The war in heaven is ongoing but waning.  This is a last call for peace before the endgame (see Isaiah's description of the earth rolling up like a scroll).

The primary axiom to build a better future is this: this is a planet of abundance.  Scarcity and emnity have been used to control and manipulate us.  That time is no more.  Zero-sum games are ending to be replaced with synergistic cumulative-sum and rolling-average games.  As Isaiah foretold, one would appear to suggest that "work we must but lunch is free" (see procure milk/honey wine/cheese without money).  This is the fundamental axiom upon which a logical framework for a egalitarian society can form.  We will call this societal form Zion where it is defined in Moses 7:18 ... which identifies the problem with scarcity societies (there are rich and poor).  There will be no poor.  And richness will be a function of being a good steward: more opportunities to serve and experience life.  This social credit system will be objective based on usage statistics, self-reports, and peer feedback.

Anchored to this pillar, society's first goal is to develop "industrious manners of living" that minimize costs of time and resources and maximizes qualtiy.  No longer will entrepreneurs try and develop demand for a product/service, now they will try to observe the customer and constantly think "how can the quality improve".  Demand will dictate supply in an abundance economy.  Demand will dictacte supply.  The first initiative is to create a self-sustaining temporal (telestial) society:  everyone needs a place to live, food to eat, clothes to wear, and a universal income to participate in hedonic activities.  This is level one of SEO: the "save everyone operation".  Recall, the war in heaven is ongoing and we want to demonstrate on earth that SEO and abundance can work, so we will develop prototypes and MVPs (minimal viable products).  Sustainable means that solutions rely on the abundant resources of this earth (water, grass, trees, aluminum, steel), that the labor is optimized to maximize quality and minimize hours worked, and that is good for GEM (e.g., net-carbon negative).

The social contract will have three levels of implementation with increasing liberty as one demonstrates the ability to thrive in that domain.  Sociality pods will be anchored to self-selection conditional on the social credit score.  The principle of sociality is defined by JS.  For example, if you are lazy and want to smoke pot all day, there will be a sociality pod where that occurs.  Such a pod should be located where the primary love (pot) can be naturally grown.  The sociality pod with attempt to maximize quality of pot and varieties for various hedonic outcomes.  There will be labor requirements for the society, yet labor contribution is a voluntary choice which will earn social credits.  So if you want to be lazy and have free food, good pot, and a place to live and just be, that is the gift of Zion.  As long as your choices do no harm to others, you will leave at the highest level of telestial living.  If harm is committed you may be relegated to the misdeamenor or felony levels of sociality.  That is the subset of sociality in the "pot" sphere will have a place for thieves to share sociality (misdeamenor) and a place for murderers to share sociality (felony).  As we transition, we have to accomodate this two dimensions.  In the long-term, they will diminish naturally, but in the transition of scarcity to abundance, behaviors of harm have been embedded into the social upbringing of individuals.  So a key teaching principle of abundance must be propogated early and often.  Other transition social pods may be the "meth-heads" and "alcoholics".  Regardless, they will be loved and supported in their current state.  So what would a terrestial or celestial "meth-heads" pod look like?  Likely stewards that study and try to understand the social phenomen with a first-priority of lifting up those in the telestial and second-priority offer optional teaching tools to advance societal knowledge on the thing.  The first gift and first axiom will direct social goals.  As JS taught, teach correct principles and let people govern themselves.

A social pod, by default will have 10 mini-houses to represent the 10 virgins, 5 to the north (masculine), 5 to the south (feminine).  They will be arranged in a circle with exterior diameter of 80 meters or so (maybe 100) and equidistantly positioned on the outer ring in a circle form.  Twelve of these primary units will also be formed into a larger circle.  Using modular design, the interfaces of this social pod to adjacent social pods will be designed.  Modular design is about cookie-cutter inputs and standarized interfaces (see Kim B. Clark "Design Rules").  A single dwelling will be pentagonal floor of 5m on each side with golden-ratio rectangular walls.  Triangular light fixtures will fill the gaps.  No wires in the walls, hemp and trees or alumnim and steel, HVAC to allow for geothermal interfacing with GEM, and so on.  The house will be roofless (when tech evolves) but for now will be transparent (polycarbonate or something) allowing you to see the sky.  Process innovations will develop to modular the process.  A social pod is 10 x 12 into a clock form.  Ideally, one of these communities could be implemented (start to finish: break ground to move in) in 10 days.  Then maybe 1 day.  This defines the optimal celestial goal (1 day) and a very ambitious terrestial goal (10 days) and then the reaiity of whatever is currently achieved.  Once the inputs and processes are defined, all that is needed is labor.  So some will choose to work on social-pod construction.  All processes will be simple enough for a 10-year old to perform, but certain subtasks may have social-credit requirements to do the work (lifting 50 pounds, operating heavy equipment, and so on).  A week will be defined as 10 days and an individual will signup for their weeks work beforehand making volutary commitment of days and hours.  These commitments will be compared to actual work performed to updated this dimension of their credit score.  In a 10-day period, there will be six work days separated into two runs of three:  two days off, three days on ... this type of work "maati" will only be performed on the six days.  The other remaining days will be for personal/spiritual development which may require service/volunteer "uru" work.  The two days off will toggle between masculine and feminine, so if it is feminine's day off, masculine workers will need to volunteer to serve the feminine.  If it is a masculine's day off, feminine workers will need to volunteer to serve the masculine.  The activities and events may differ based on telestial/terrestial/celestial as before.  Notice the social contract is even modular in its design and interfaces.  So on masculine "play day" (pinkie day), a man with celestial credit scores may choose to role-play a telestial felon and live out a fantasy with a willing female partner (or partners).  His play date, his parameters.  If no volunteers, no play for him, but if you "think celestial" why would one not volunteer?  The world is after all a stage, and we are all mere actors.  It's a play, so play.  The pinkie day is play day, left side is feminine.  The spiritual day is the thumb day, reverence to GEM and God or nature or whatever.  A personally defined spiritual day.  And from afar, one man's play day may be another man's spiritual day.  Let that sink in.  The key principle of "spiritual day" is that reverence is paid to the gift, the source of the gift, and the first axiom.

The mini-pod (10 mini-houses) will have shared community spaces, mostly outdoor in nature, with a tree of life at its center.  A good candidate for such a tree is Quercus Montana, the chestnut tree as it produces fruit (for humans and animals) and offers shade.  One form of the mini-house may have a tree inside its center as well, small indoor tree, living, "pee on a tree."  The mini-house is dorm-like in the sense that you can change houses frequently (this week I want to live in "meth-heads", next week I want to live in "potheads" so I will use my play day to travel and move).  Hedonic pleasures will be created for the desired activity: community BBQ area, waterpark for children, love shacks, and so on.  There will be common community gathering areas for meals and entertainment (cafeteria and bonfire).

Rather than competition for goods, there will be competition for quality.  There will be one "oven" class with up to 9 models.  And that is all.  The community of "oven" will gather data and feedback and constantly make improvements until saturation or satiation is achieved.  Maybe one community of practice (100 social pods: 100 x [12 x 10] = 12,000 houses) will work on the "oven" but over time, it is reduced to just manufacturing and distribution so the 100 social pods shrink to 23.  The unused pods can be used for some other sociality pod with growing need.  In the long run, this will be the natural life cycle of a sociality pod.  Pods can be an interaction of socialities.  With 100 social pods, maybe one group of "ovens" like "pot", so that is accomodated.  Obviously, an "ovens"-"smoker" may not be "ovens"-"pot" but that may be the closest available sociality.  Scheduling will have various criteria for scheduling and priority.  Some people may be "evicted" from their social pod if the credit system so defines or if another party with a higher credit score needs to living space.

For every social pod [10 x 12], there will be a common hostel environment (longhouse) and a common recreation center and raised structure for the bridgegroom.  With 12 o'clock being EAST, 1:30 would be longhouse, 6 o'clock would be bridegroom temple/house, 10:00 would be common recreation center.  Or something like that.

05:00 AM ... not much left in the tank to pontiphicate...
05:25 ... as I ponder, the heaviness/gravitas returns, am I the wicked one ?!? who am I?  do I naturally believe in meritocracy or is that just my avatar?  is the "jester" my true self ... did I make someone angry and suffered for it and this is the retribution for the suffering ... or am I the jester that tried to usurp God's ways (possible, but I have a hard time believing that).  Is my foggy memory (iba) empowering me to do good ... or is it a way to extract information from me freely.  Heavy!
