## Moses 
The story of Moses is the glue that binds Judeo-Christian traditions.

In order to appreciate the story, we have to layout the key principles of the event.  Words like "congeal" and "lead" and eagles-wings will inform our understanding of "dry land" to "as if dry land".  That is, let's dig into the Masoretic Hebrew and Septuagint Greek.

### Context
The event of the "crossing" occurred during the month of the passover (at inception) which would be very near the Aries Equinox, circa March 21, of the event year (much debate over that date, not important for the discussion regarding "what happened" exactly).  The location does matter for this discussion.  We will assume the Khar-Khar (Horeb) is a mountain of significance across the human story, a cross roads for Abraham, Moses, Nephi, Jesus, Mohammed (and others) and is located in the land of Midian (Arabia), specifically the tallest mountain in the region, the Mountain of Almonds (Jabal Al-Lawz).  That is, it is "the mountain of all mountains".  The crossing occurred at exactly 29 degrees north latitude (near Nuweiba which in ancient Egyptian may indicate the event "nu-uah-iba").

Today, [Nuweiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuweiba) has a minimum temperature of 50 degrees in January and about 57 degrees in March.  The sea (surface) temperature is about 72 degrees in January and 70 degrees in March.  The [bathometer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03765-8/figures/2) data for the Gulf of Aqaba shows a maximum depth of about 1000 meters at the crossing location.  At this depth, modern readings show a similar sea temperature of 70 degrees (at 700 meters at the observation location further north).  Although the [Levant](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282773661_The_climate_variability_in_northern_Levant_over_the_past_20000_years) has interesting temperature fluctuations over time, we will assume the modern temperature is similar to the "crossing" temperature.  The presence of rivers (wadis with flowing water) are also an interesting data point that should be considered.

- About March 21
- At 29 degrees north latitude 
- Air temperature would have been about 57 degrees and sea temperature would have been about 70 degrees.

### Biblical Context 
The story is concise in the Old Testament yet Isaiah and the Psalmist provide additional anchors for insight.

#### heap 
Ex 15:8 (comparison to Jos 3:13/3:16 when the Jordan river was also crossed - BetaBara)
Psa 33:7 references the depth of the sea is heaped into "storehouses" - cylindric form?
?Hab 3:8-15 walk "through the sea" through the heap of great water - God also had horses and chariots?

#### dry ground 
Ex 14:16 How do you go on dry ground "in the midst" of the sea?  Read the Hebrew.  It seems to imply "as-if" dry ground.  The House of Jacob walked over the congealed water like you would step over a cadaver in the street (Isaiah 50/52) whereas the Egyptians "sank like lead"
Ex 14:21 strong east will all night, making the sea "as-if" dry land ... the waters were "divided": [H1234](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1234/kjv/wlc/0-1/) suggests the water beein cleaved open, ripped open, "as if" cut be the staff
Ex 14:22 "midst" [tavek](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8432/kjv/wlc/0-1/) implies the middle - was all of the water removed and they had to descend 1000 meters as they crossed, OR was the surface of the water removed and the congealed "deep waters" were slushy/icy for them to meander across.  This is a large difference in volume of water needing to be displaced, and God is Almighty, but Almighty also implies efficient.
Moses commands with his staff/rod (as opposed to Aaron's rod/staff) and in Nephi we get the addition "Moses spoke" (abracadabra? - heard the cry Neh 9:9 and answered Isa 50:2)
"dry ground" in 14:22 has the "bayit" preposition that is translated as upon.
Ex 14:29, Ex 15:19, Neh 9:11 (stones), Psa 66:6 (went through the flood [stream/river] on foot - is it dry or "as-if dried)
Isa 50:2 dry up the sea, make the rivers a wilderness? (is this drought or the event?)

#### lead/feather 
Ex 15:1 The song of the crossing ... 15:5 they sank as stone 
Ex 15:10 They sank as lead when the sea covered them ... 
Ex 19:4 Did you not rejoice at what I did to the Egyptians when I bore you up on eagles-wings
Ex 15:12, the right hand (south) had the earth swallow them (mud? or water?)
Ex 15:16 Your people shall cross "as still as a stone" - does this suggest they are walking gently
[gal] as redeemed [ga'al] as a wave 

Ex 15:8 water streams gathered together and stood upright (like a heap/storehouse - mound or wave)
[tehom] depths were congealed [H7087](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7087/kjv/wlc/0-1/) in the heart of the sea ... how does water "thicken" or congeal" - slush? [qapha] can mean frozen water.  The deep became firm walls

#### divide 
Psa 74:13, was this H1234 a violent cutting or tearing, a memory of primordial times when the sea was dried and the dragons defeated?

#### rebuke [H1606]
Psa 18:15, 2 Sa 22:16 can his nostril breath be cold as in flash-freeze Frozo cold?
Psa 76:6
Isa 50:2, 51:20, 66:15 refers to a rebuke of fire ...



### Possible Explanation
Water needs to be cold to freeze, about 40 degrees fahrenheit for fresh water and lower temperatures for salt water.  All night, an "east wind was blowing" was this the wind of the cold ice dragon.  Once the water is cold enough, a flash freeze event can let you stack water like a slushy snow cone ... see the instant ice glitch [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zdghpZpNOwo)

Was this the same technology Jesus used to walk on water?

Notice, I respect the divine to use the rules of science in an extraordinary way.

Wind cools the water of the sea for 24 hours, when Moses speaks with his rod/staff, the water is "torn apart" and ice/slushy walls are formed (see YouTube example).  A constant wind would continue to create a wall of a slushy mountain minimizing the overall need for massive displacement.  The House of Jacob would be terrified as they crossed.  They understood ice I imagine, but this instant ice was delicate and fragile, as they walked like feathers on the surface whereas the Egyptians sank like a stone or lead ... if a pillar from heaven was creating this frozen-zone wind, the slush ice would be unstable and easily melt if temperature reduction is not being maintained - or better yet, the fire-column drops down where the Egyptians are crossing and immediately melts everything...

[abar] as [H5674](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5674/kjv/wlc/0-1/) is the go over, the crossing... stepping over the sea like one would step over a corpse... ever so carefully. For about 15 kilometers

### Take a stand of faith in the place of possibility
The Mormon church needs to stop be Babylon pleasers and stand as servants to nurture the vineyard one last time.  What a great anchor of faith.  Ani Nafi university could have a team explore the hydrology of such an event using the surface tension, capillary effects, and so on.  Could this flash-freeze slushee surface be a solution? 

Ron Wyatt was an extremist, but his ideas have merit.  So let's use science to test some hypotheses.  Send crews of divers to Nuweiba and look for actual artifacts.  Do soil samples, sea samples, wadi samples to understand the flora and fauna of this location.  God's ways are not our ways, but is not the purpose to work out his ways?  Life eternal to know God?

Ultimately, the keys to creation can be unlocked if we can find the Liahona and read it.  All of the gaps in science and technology will diminish, we will work out the last 4+ quantum particles to create a unified theory and address conundrums baffling us (wave-particle duality, Schrodinger's cat, Heisenberg's uncertainty, etc.)

What are the key drivers?
- Repent, read Isaiah 1 and Epistle of Jacob - focus efforts on a abundance economy with arg max/min to feed the world and house the world for free ... a land of milk and honey (wine and cheese) procured without money.  What seed capital is needed to get it launched?  What is required in terms of labor contributions to make it sustainable... Hemp crete and hemp insulation videos from yesterday (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLXXjvQXgI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5dcBqTpDeE&pp=0gcJCa0JAYcqIYzv).
- Search, the knowledge of Jehovah shall fill the world as waters fill the sea ... the best search would be for the Liahona.  However, concurrently, a search of ancient sites and an open-sharing paradigm, e.g., the anti-Smithsonian Institute (maybe call it the Joseph Smithsonian institute - he ruffled feathers with the group in his era).  Go bold, brand in opposition to Babylon.  Create a modular housing system and call it Apple in reference to Adam/Eve.  Modular, local, scalable.

We just need to set-seed(NULL) and let the rest take care of itself.  Ask the CIA idiots for an initial commitment of 100B each, and figure out ways to make everything efficient with high-quality results.  Focus on "Ancient American" reparations first - all the first nations.  Simultaneous focus on widows/fatherless (are not Native groups a good test-case of this).  The objective is simple:  how to feed, clothe, and house everyone on earth.  Using the best inputs (most abundant and sustainable):  water, hemp, trees, aluminum, steel, etc.  Lithium and rare earth minerals are not abundant, so they are poor choices.  Have geo-thermal systems for modular AC units (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-41UF02vrU).  Plumb the base 10 units for a walk-in fridge/freezer and figure out how to transfer heat to shower, capture rainwater, have a green house on south "corner" of each unit... helicopter or crane install.  Modular design in creation, scaling, installing.  Dirt boys move earth and prep the area on day 1, on day 2, homes are installed.  By day 10, we have move in?  Initial benchmarks.  Can we get it down to one 10-set start to finish from sunrise to sunset in one day.  10-set with basics, 12 of those formed with North as third dividers for train tech.  100 of those is a community: 10 x 12 = 120 x 100 = 12000 ... the hundred can be a bigger shape, lots of space for crops or cattle or whatever.
