## Addendum

Since learning is an iterative process, enabling 'track-changes' will allow one to see the expansion of the main thesis of RML:BOMO as in Restoring Mormon Lore: Book of Mormon Origins

### Gender Wars
2024-09-10 3.1415926535897932384626... (pi time)

Revelation demonstrates that the war in heaven is gender related.  As the Messiah Death Event is understood, part of the 'expiacion' is to address this gender conflict.  Seemingly, as one delves into the story of Nephi, this gender conflict has been deeply masked by editorialization.  Prophetic references can help separate and isolate such editorialization to elucidate.

#### Sons of Helaman vs Sons of Moron
The sons of Helaman were obliged by Moroni to dishonor the oath of their fathers and take up arms to engage in war.  The faith of these true descendants of Lehi astounded Helamen.  They had faith in all things their mothers had taught them.  Seemingly, the mothers were the ones to save their family units; to negotiate with Moroni so the families would not die.  To bless their sons with knowledge to fight for righteous sake.  Almost, as if, there was a history in the legend of Nephi.  One could consider that Nephi was a daughter.  A female.  I am willing to stand in the place of possibility and contemplate such a reality.  Is it internally consistent with the narrative?  Not likely.  On the other hand, the conflation of the parents in the introduction makes it very possible that there was a gender conflict between mother/father.  One complained, the other was visionary.  And we are given names of Lehi and Sarai to them.  Sa'ami may literally mean my brother, son of my mother.  We assume a monogamous family dynamic, that Jacob, the brother of Nephi, had the same mother/father.  All sorts of assumptions we place on the text.

Moron or Morom may have been a primary female character in the narrative.  Let's examine some important prophecies regarding the journey through Arabia enroute to the Americas.

##### Gen 49:22
Joseph is a fruitful bough, by a well, branches run over a wall.

In English, we have the bough/branches and well/wall literary framework.  But what over the Hebrew?

Son Fruitful Joseph ... Son Fruitful Beyond (Leaf [ali]) ... Daughters Beyond ([ali]) Journey (wall/border)

The son Joseph is Fruitful.  His sons are fruitful beyond these borders.  His daughters journey through the mountain borders.

##### Isa 30:6
Is the young/old lion a reference to having sons/having fathers?  Pure religion is to take care of the widows and the fatherless.  To provide a son to the widows who have know son.  Just as the ancient temple grounds would have a house of the virgens, would there not also be a house of the widows and for pubescent boys a house of the striplings?

Isa 30 sets the stage for the sins of the KOHEN to unretire the Ark of the Covenant and to anchor to the "shadow" power of the Pharoah to use it for war.  To cover and march with it.  Verse 6 seems to say that it was taken away.  Some say Josiah went to war hiding as to not show his appearance.  Others say part of the Huldah prophecy was to tell Josiah he would die soon.  Maybe the tabernacle was taken directly to the south.

Maybe, "And my father dwelt in a tent" was in fact, "And my mother dwelt in a tent"... the visual difference is important, the Mayim implies that within the tent borders, there is water for the animals and family.  Water is important in the deserts of desolation (sarah soq).

Laman/Laban may be a debate between the sons/fathers regarding the purpose of the Ark.  Was this the houses of widows/striplings that performed this deed?  Striplings may be fatherless, but would still have wealth and inheritance.  Did they keep such wealth in the treasurer that was exploited by the KOHEN which brings them shame/reproach?  That is, the KOHEN are already a den of thieves, taking the beauty of the temple design to support the poor, to rob the poor.

v. 20: the teachers of the MISNE will be no longer be ignored as they wander away with their teachings


#### Walls
Nephi climbs a wall to sneak into the city at night.  Where is Laban?  There are several gates, there are timekeepers (waterclocks) with calls of the night.  How does he dispose of the body?  Does he throw it into the garbage/trash associated with the temple where the dogs feed on the parts not burned to ash, but discarded in a disregarding way?

Samuel the Lamanite climbs walls and has arrows shot at him.  An honor I imagine, maybe a reference to Nephi?

Teancum with his copper javelin climbs a wall and kills a man where he sleeps.  Did Nephi find him sleeping?  Why would Teancum not behead the enemy like Nephi?  Was Nephi near where the Messiah Death Event may occur in the temple?

Ancient Americans may have had a bravery tactic of "counting coup" where they would scalp but not kill a man to show bravery.  To make the enemy bald and hairless.

Outside the walls, the brothers waited in the catacombs.  Where the poor live and hide (a cave?).  When the brothers were beating on Nephi, was it an angel in the flesh (a Joseph Smith angel) that rescued Nephi or an angel from the spirit (celestial light angel)?

Samuel => Lemuel, what is the "el" ending for Yahwists?  How does the Egyptian language NOT have the "l" sound like lion?

### Liahona ... river islands, the way to
Embedded in the hebrew (like Lehi), the fundamental meaning is the journey to the river island, as in a guidance tool.

At the time, waterclocks would announce the hours of the night.  Isaiah confronted Ahaz making the "sundial" go back ten steps.  Likely a 3-D sundial with seasonal adjustments (aka Resort Xcaret).  Maybe it was an entire stairway replica.

The Liahona was spherical and likely had a glass-crystal component, analagous to a "Urim".  A lens of sorts to measure the sun or stars.

That is, it would measure shadow (sundial) if appropriately aligned.  It was an astrolabe to measure stars.

In Alma, Nephi is thrown under the bus for his "sins" which caused the Liahona to stop functioning.  Was this factual, that got editorialized by Smith/Cowdery/Ridgon?  Or was it fiction, based on Nephi's non-mono views (polygenesis, polytheism, polyamory)?  In the history of the world with all of its citizenry, Nephi is one of the last person's I would want to do a stare-down at the judment bar.  Maybe one of the four great "seraphs" of this world!

lia-h.oma as lei-yah-h.oma?
