## Book of Mormon as "Translation" of Ancient American Record

There are many that will devoutly swear to the polemic logic (outlined by the Book of Mormon itself in Moroni 10) and institutionalized as the proselyting logic by Talmage:  if the Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith must have been a prophet, and therefore, the Church he created must be the only TRUE and LIVING Church in all the world.

### Proof the "translation" process included "editorialization"
To begin, the absurdity of the polemics argument will be challenged. What does the bringing forth of an ancient record have to do with the formation of an institution and its veracity?  I do not recall Isaiah saying that "because God spoke to me, I demand everyone to follow me and my teachings as it is the ONE and ONLY TRUE WAY."  That Joseph Smith brought forth an Ancient Record is a good thing, why conflate the good with the philosophies of men, mingled with scripture and make such an absurd claim?  Sadly, such audacity is very much non-inclusive.

But what if the original farewell message of Moroni was expanded in the editorial process to be more Pauline and less Egyptian/Hebrew in nature?  Was the polemic logic introduced editorially by Sidney Rigdon as a leverage of the Ancient American Record to grow a Church movement?  


Based on the discussions between Talmage and BH Roberts a century later, it does seem like primary-source documents substantiated my claim that Joseph Smith Jr. received an Ancient American Record which was highly editorialized and expanded by Sidney Rigdon.  BH Roberts likely realized that many of the inner circle during Joseph's lifetime also knew this.  At this decisive moment in the Utah-based Brigham Synod of the Mormon movement, Talmage convinced the leadership to  continue with the polemics of Moroni 10, to double-down on the effort with the missionary effort and release of the 1920 edition of the Book of Mormon.  Recall, both Talmage and BH Roberts were carefully analyzing every primary-source document available to prepare the 1920 edition.  In addition, Talmage was likely the apostolic oversight on BH Roberts development of the official History of the Church.  During his tenure, BH Roberts took a much more reasonable and educated position:  the Ancient American Record was a vehicle used by men (with their philosophies) to develop a religious institution that hopefully helps people develop a relationship with the celestial.  BH Roberts knew that the triangulation of history, archaelogy, and science would demonstrate the veracity of the Ancient American Record; however, it would also reveal my premise:  the underlying text was highly expanded and modified to enable Joseph and Sidney to create a religious movement and institution.

BH Roberts as Church historian had access to every scrap of primary-source documentation.  Documentation that we do not have access to today, or was destroyed.  So we must conjecture as to why BH Roberts would stand contrary to Church leadership in their polemics strategy.  Maybe there were other manuscript fragments or letters and drafts couriered between Joseph and Sidney, possibly by Parley P. Pratt (who, like Sidney, was officially NOT part of the story until AFTER the publication).  Maybe BH Roberts had the privilege of seeing the original source text Joseph possessed.  Was this the important papers Joseph gave to Emma to conceal when she crossed the frozen Mississippi River with her young children?  Or possibly, after synthesizing all the history during his tenure, BH concluded that the inner circle knew of the true process: Joseph as Prophet had original text with innovative content and in an effort to bring it forth had contacted Sidney to prepare it for publication.  Sidney, a grammarian and minister, likely obliged, yet offered much more than Joseph wanted.  The ademant and active opposition to the 'Solomon Spalding' accusation is in itself informative.  As is the realities of the Church formation: although Sidney was senior in age and had a better acumen for the institutionalization of the movement, he never claimed seniority to the contributions made by Joseph.  And, of course, Sidney did seek this seniority after the martyrdom of Joseph/Hyrum and poisoning of Don Carlos, but Brigham's preparations for a claim to leadership prevailed for the main body of followers.

Whatever primary-source documents BH Roberts reviewed, he arrived at a reasonable counter-position:  We should be grateful of our ancestral pioneer heritage and embrace the wholeness of Joseph Smith and his movement.  We should embrace the innovativeness with the weaknesses of the man and his movement.  We should NOT push a polemic position of absolutist rhetoric regarding the Church itself.  Rather, we should offer that our religion is "a way, a life, and a truth" NOT "the only way, the only life, and the only truth".   Maybe I am over-extending BH's conclusions.  Maybe.  I would conclude the BH wanted Mormonism to be less polemic and more inclusive; more humility and less hubris with the polemic claims.  At the same time, BH believed that the veracity of the Ancient American Record would be demonstrated using science and reasoning.  I suspect that BH realized that such a demonstration of the source-text veracity would require a reveal of the editorialization that occurred during the preparation phase.  

In this frame, God gave Joseph Smith Jr. a single marvelous work and wonder as a task: to bring forth the Ancient American Record.  Joseph likely was motivated for more, and asked for it.  So God gave Joseph what he wanted (ask and ye shall receive), allowing Joseph to learn how the philosophies of man will mingle with scripture to distort the truth and imbue instututional powers (D&C 121).  Or said differently, "You will learn dear Joseph, that men will honor Me with their lips, but remove their hearts from Me."  Interestingly, it would seem that Joseph learned this lesson.  His speech when the manuscript (not the original text) was sealed up in the corner of the Nauvoo House suggests this collaborative process with scribes and editors was the "bane of his existence".  And it is highly likely the mob of Carthage was associated with the power structures within the movement that wanted to shut off the valve of innovative content and move forward with stabilizing the formidable institutional movement.  

Maybe if Joseph had died sooner, it would have been without this potential Mahan involvement from within.  Perhaps the mob of Missouri was intended to take his life with David Patten at the Battle of Crooked River in 1838 (there was an interesting exchange between David and Joseph preceding the battle; David proclaimed that he felt like he was going to his death as a martyr; Joseph replied something like 'be careful what you wish for'; after David was gut shot, he was taken home and put to bed; no surgeries were attempted on the torso as such things were still considered blasphemy; Joseph stayed with David and his family until he died; maybe all of this was a teaching moment from the heavens for Joseph, a preparation of sorts.)  Or maybe Alexander Doniphane was NOT supposed to step in and save his life.  Maybe it would have been better for the Missouri mob to perform its deed of martyrdom in 1838.  Certainly that would have been a significant change-point in the Mormon movement.

When Joseph was 37 years old, 30 days [January 1843], he gave a very interesting sermon about the circle of life and returning to the dust of the earth.  And so, when Joseph finally faced the music, it was his choice.  And maybe God was giving Joseph time to make this choice.  Joseph and Hyrum were on a ferry crossing the Mississippi with an inner circle of friends (and likely at least one spy).  They were heading to the Rocky Mountains to start afresh, to leave the God-forsaken country so that a new government could be formed.  A new Zion.  A new Jerusalem.  A new United Order.  Seemingly, Joseph and Hyrum together decided that they should return to Carthage, load some pistols and have their moment of Butch Cassiday and the Sundance Kid.  If you carefully follow the logic, the Rocky Mountains were not a safe heaven for the brothers as the opposition within the Mormon movement would follow them there.  They had lived interesting lives and it would seem the heavens had prepared them for Carthage.  A form of fate intermingled with the agency of all parties involved.


#### Situational Context Enabling Editorialization
The young Joseph Smith Jr., according to the official timeline, received celestial visitations on September 21, 1823.  Was that Saturday night, September 20th into Sunday early AM, September 21st?  Regardless of the minutiae, these "visitations of angels" as later described occurred during a FULL moon [https://nineplanets.org/moon/phase/9-20-1823/].

The Book of Mormon was published in 1830.  Between these time posts, the Ancient Record had to be retrieved, original text had to be dictated and edited and prepared for publication.  The printer made note how the prepared manuscript (internally called by believers the "original manuscript" copied as the "printer's manuscript) had little punctuation and many run-on sentences.  The key scholar in this domain is Royal Skousen who would only "step out of line" to conclude that Oliver was tricky.  This means that, according to Royal, Oliver Cowdery would make edits to the manuscript and Joseph kept having to review the work to make certain this did NOT continue.

- Critical analysis of the location of run-on sentence density and poor grammar and punctation will very likely reveal that certain segments of text seemed to have fewer such problems.  I would set forth as a proposition that many of the so-called speeches of the Book of Mormon meet this criteria.

What is essential to the internal narrative was to thwart the "Solomon Spalding" rumor as the original source for the contents of the Book of Mormon.  [http://sidneyrigdon.com/]  Although a careful examination will find this accusation lacking in evidence, the point that the early Church considered the accusation worthy of thwarting - this is the key data point.  And furthermore, the accusation suggested that there was an underlying original text that was edited and prepared into the final manuscript.

- Sidney Rigdon was a RedStone Baptist removed from this association for pushing "infancy salvation"; Sidney had a large Campbellite following and was seeking "new gospel material" to grow his ministry.  This is a key data point regarding "Solomon Spalding".  And very likely, as you consider the Pauline Baptist contents interlaced throughout the 1830 Book of Mormon, Sidney Rigdon was a co-author with Joseph Smith Jr. and Oliver was merely a scribal secretary that was responsible for merging the two threads into one coherent manuscript.

Once you can recognize the intentional efforts to leverage the Ancient American Record to grow a church movement, the ability to identify the Pauline Baptish Campbellite Ridgon philosophies are much more plausible.  For antagonists, this fine point is irrelevant; the baby goes out with the bathe water.  For apologists, this potential reality is NOT comfortable.  Yet, this may be the way forward.  A way to fulfill the prophetic counsel offered in D&C 123:  to waste and wear out our lives to bring the truth from the darkness for the benefit of our children.  Cosmic irony at its best.  And a cosmic lesson regarding entropy of mediocrity for self-preservation of institutional norms.  The antithesis of innovative frames. 

#### Motivation to leverage Ancient Record to grow a Church
The early Church went through several institutional changes very rapidly: (1) the ideal organization of Joseph Smith, (2) the Whitmer influence, (3) the Rigdon influence, (4) the Brigham synod with smaller schism movements, (5) the Talmage polemics, (6) the Hinckley bureaucracy, (7) the Nelson 'trust leadership' with its strong 'hold fast to the iron rod' messaging.

Joseph Smith, Jr. had an uncle who started a religious movement (Lucy's brother Jason) after having adventures on the high seas (possible source of the idea for Joseph Smith, Sr.: grow gingseng and sell to China) and losing the 'love of his life' so retreating into the northeast and starting a commune.  Why is this relevant data point overlooked?  His childhood was full of agitation and unease.  

When Joseph Smith, Jr. did initiate the Church, he communicated that he wanted it to be a "religion without creeds" and was immediately under pressure by those around him to outline official creeds.  Olivery Cowdery had a draft of 8 such creeds that Joseph Smith was well aware of in 1830 but would not adopt (or be forced to adopt by institutional pressures) until over a decade later (1842 Wentworth letter where 13 Articles of Faith were canonized).  As I recollect, Joseph attended a early Church service with Oliver where a member of the Congregation felt moved by the spirit and in what we would term modernly a Pentecostal moment, the man swung from the rafters singing praises, speaking in tongues, until he hit his head severely and was unconscious for a time.  Oliver likely turned to Joseph and reminded him that creeds were a necessary evil.

#### Whitmer Context
Oliver Cowdery married one of the Whitmer daughters and the Whitmer home was where the most important translation occurred, the final chapter of the process: the small plates of Nephi.  Mother Whitmer was milking the cow when Brother Nephi appeared to her as a normal man and showed her these records; she was likely the first witness of this physical Ancient American Record.  Yet, she was a woman, so in 1830s America, her witness was excluded.  As 8 is greater than 3, this second record was the entire purpose of the first record.  The former was a training and trial period, the latter was the main event.

Mother Whitmer would have been exhausted taking care of the men staying with her.  This describes the nature of the environment of the Whitmer home.  Joseph would receive some original text of the Ancient American Record, and the men would spend hours pouring over every word and philosophizing on its meaning and implication.  And based on the worldviews of the Whitmers, a basic organization began the Church with Joseph and Oliver as First Elders.  No one doubted Joseph was a prophet because the content he was creating was new, novel, and inspiring.  However, in the Whitmer era, that did not mean the institution should have hierarchy; there would be lots of Elders equal in the eyes of God; Joseph and Oliver happened to be the first such Elders.  Joseph would form an idea of School of the Prophets with an inclusive definition as anyone with the "spirit of testimony of Jesus" which again would get hampered to be a men-only organization.  This would explain why so many women of the early Church were so enamored with him; he was trying to give them a place of equality within the religion; in fact, their own body of religious service (the Relief Society).  Joseph was trying to restore the ancient MISNE which can be interpreted as college or school of the prophets and prophetesses.  The most important remnant of this ancient institution was the story of King Josiah who received counsel from the prophetess Huldah (the keeper of the wardrobe within the MISNE) and followed her spiritual direction exactly.  1830's America was not interested in such things within an institutional religion, but such views would enamore the feminine with Joseph's vision of God's Church.

Hiram Page witnesses this translation phenomenon that Joseph performs and wants to give it a try using his own personal seer stone (Hiram married into the Whitmer family and many of the Whitmers had such stones).  Joseph is anxious, and after carefully consideration, convinces the core group to destroy the Hiram stone, burn the revelation, and so begins the natural gravities of power formation.  The concept of equality did not last long.

Taking a step back, how did Joseph and the Whitmers become so strongly connected?  The connection was through Oliver Cowdery.  Hyrum Smith, Joseph's older brother was a member of the local school board and hired Oliver Cowdery; in fact, the brother of Oliver was hired but could not perform the duties so Oliver was the replacement.  Such a data point may be factually true, or may be a contrived narrative to make the entire Church-building process more palatable.  

#### Hyrum Smith's prominence, education, and connections
Regardless, the data remains that Hyrum Smith had some local prominence to get Oliver Cowdery placed as a teacher in Manchester.  Oliver was also involved in treasure-seeking using a divining rod, so maybe the Smith boys crossed paths with him previously.  Hyrum Smith was also well-educated for this rural setting having attended a school in his teens on the campus of Dartmouth College; seemingly, Hyrum stayed behind in Vermont to attend school for a few years while the family moved to Palmyra following Joseph's bone surgery.  Dartmouth College had some of the first doctors openly practicing non-wartime surgery in 1800s America.  The "bone surgery" story of Joseph's youth demonstrates that: (1) Lucy Mack had money to pay doctors for their constant visits (20 total doctors participated in Joseph's diagnosis and treatment), (2) Joseph would spend significant time in medical settings and therefore would have advanced access to the belief systems of these doctors, (3) Lucy Mack was convinced to perform a surgery on her son based on limited evidence (and even modern uncertainty) being assured that a leg surgery did not have the same spiritual consequence as a surgery in the human core (which was considered spiritual blaspheme among Christians at the time), (4) Joseph's typhoidal (more likely syphilic) condition is a cosmic tie-in to the "sore curse" described in the Book of Mormon that could turn a man or woman black down there (the genitalia region commonly called shame in the 1830s).

What seems to be lacking from the preparation narratives is the role of Hyrum.  Five years senior to Joseph, Hyrum was an older brother that intentionally returned to Carthage to be with his brother at the end.  Certainly, Hyrum would have been involved during the mansucript preparation.

[insert daguerreotype of Hyrum, painting of Joseph here]

#### Provenance failure with initial preparation  
During the manuscript creation process, the first portion of the creation was lost when Joseph loaned Martin Harris the only copy of the prepared manuscript in an whole form.  Martin significantly financed the entrepreneurial enterprise.  Martin already helped Joseph by giving him $50 so Joseph could move.  In addition, Martin had promised to finance a significant portion of the printing costs of the first edition of the Book of Mormon.  Martin mortgaged some property as collateral and would turn a very healthy profit once the Book of Mormon was published and sold.

Again, this classic narrative of the "lost 116 pages" has key data points that are largely ignored.  The first is:  why would Martin even consider asking if others were not doing the same?  If you review the history carefully, before the  6 April 1830 formal and official church formation (with a legal business license and everything), missionaries were called to share the good news of the Messianic visit to Ancient America.  One such missionary was Joseph's brother Don Carlos.  These missionaries would show up at the "translation shack" and copy portions of texts from a source text and would share these fragments to interested parties as evidence of what is coming.   A basic marketing tactic of trial before purchase likely to secure pre-orders for the book.  It is estimated that before 6 April, over 1700 had already been baptized.   After 6 April, Joseph suggested they get "re-baptized" as he did not have an anchor like many established ministers of "one baptism".  Of interest is the question:  where are these scraps of paper?  To a devout believer, these fragments would be highly valued.  Maybe the vault of the Mormon synod keeps them under lock and key, but if you follow the narrative of the time, the reality is a bit more mundane.  Joseph Smith likely demanded the scraps be collected and burned BEFORE the interested party could receive the entire book.  

A second key data point is:  where was the source material to attempt to recreate the lost pages?  The official narrative is that Joseph tried to recraft the narrative which mostly consisted of the Book of Lehi with a few chapters about Mosiah/Benjamin.  God inspired Joseph to stop because the ability to achieve something exactly the same was impossible.  Of course it is!  Have you ever written a long treatise and lose the entire document.  It is gut wrenching!  The next draft will deviate significantly from the original draft.  But to a group of men with mediocre education and a belief that the devil was trying to thwart their work and that lesser men will think lesser of the work if compared, this thinking process makes complete sense.  This just informs us as to the logical frame of Joseph and his inner circle.  

Next, to do such a recreation, it is very likely they had original notes (which I will call the TRUE original text).  To me, this is an important anchor to the veracity of some ancient source material.  Joseph and his editors had source material (that seemingly Joseph provided) that got translated meaning it got verbosely described in what this group considered to be elegant and intelligent language when, in fact, it was old Biblical English that was 30-40 years antiquated.  

During one of the updates of the Book of Mormon, there was some confusion about a name.  Mosiah should have been Benjamin or vice versa.  After careful review, an edit was made.  Although not fully developed, this does suggest that some original-text notes may in fact exist.

Furthermore, in an effort to "beat the devil at his game" (again an ignorant perspective because if you are playing the devil's game, you have already lost), the content that was lost was carefully sprinkled in thereafter as possible.  If you read the legend of Nephi carefully (1 Nephi and 2 Nephi), several times an introjection is made:  "I Nephi will tell my story, but let me get back to my father's story first."  And of course, if you can buy a few mummies and ancient papyrus, what a great way to include other fragments from the original text (the Book of Abraham) or just claim you received it by inspiration as you began translating the Old Testament (the Book of Moses).  Et oila!  A Pearl of Great Price!

Finally, the edits were intentional for building a religious movement in the 1830s.  That is, the original text said X which was massaged into X'Y to present a favorable message that could be adopted in that era.  Some possible clues of such changes are found in 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi:  (1) a conflation of the "parents" where the man is the visionary and the woman complains, (2) the removal of the narrative about the Ark of the Covenant, (3) the removal of other key ideas that would be ridiculed in 1830s America: the name Colon-mbia and 2100 year prophecy, the word America the Bountiful (or Beautiful), ...

Since the legend of Nephi was written last, the text had to be massaged to fit in the existing manuscript and a transition was needed from the small plates to the lost Mosiah narrative.  Likely the Words of Mormon had a few extra phrases added.  Mormon had included the Book of Lehi, so any transitional clarifications to account for the 'lost pages' would have been editorial decisions made by the Joseph Smith editorial team.  And, it would seem, that years passed and no one revealed the lost pages, so the original texts were reviewed and narratives were created to release some important ideas from the Book of Lehi:  namely the writings of Moses and Abraham, a Pearl of Great Price.


#### Sidney involvement
Now, overlay the Sidney variable.  Sidney was older than Joseph Smith.  Sidney already had experience as a sanctioned member of a Baptist association.  Sidney was known for his careful use of language and was a stickler for grammar as he studied it in his youth.  Religiously, Sidney fervently believed that "children were saved through the grace of Jesus" if they were not of an age of accountability.  Are you capable of considering the possibility that much of the Book of Moroni were Sidney sermons; that is, Moroni wrote in his terse evolved Egyptian and Sidney expanded the terse into an opus of Pauline philosophy.

When Sidney was dismissed from his Baptist association for his strong views on "infant salvation", he was looking for a way back into the ministry and had ambitions to grow his world views in a religious movement.  During this time (1823-1826), Sidney was being approached by people with new and novel religious ideas.  Seemingly, Sidney would entertain such audiences.

Little is known about Joseph's activities during his preparation to receive the plates.  Joseph was likely working on the family property and continuing his outsourcing activities of digging wells, searching for gold, and such.  Geographically, Joseph and Sidney were separated by 200 or so miles.  Did they meet during this time?  And if so, would they have devised a strategy of collaboration that would distance themselves until the opportune moment?  Sidney does NOT officially enter into the Mormon flock until about six months after the publication of the Book of Mormon and the official formation of the Church of Latter-day Saints.

If we had a collection of Sidney writings and sermons, modern linguistic analysis would easily demonstrate Sidney's contributions to the formation of the manuscript that would be published as the Book of Mormon.  Certainly, Joseph was also contributing innovative content to this endeavor.  Sidney seemed to be uninterested in much of the minutiae but loved inserting sermons that demonstrated his understanding of Christianity based on his internal belief system.  If accurate, this implies that there is still an original source text that Joseph is receiving from somewhere.

Considering this possibility, things begin to fit together more coherently.  If there were courier-exchanges of different portions of the manuscript intentionally separated by distance, there would need to be an executive secretary that would synthesis the edits into a common manuscript (Oliver Cowdery).  And if Martin Harris witnessed some of these courier transactions, this would give him the impetus to ask permission to also courier the manuscript for a time.  He was financing the endeavor!  Just as Don Carlos was taking fragments to convince the unbelieving, Martin wanted to show his wife what he was investing in.  Seemingly, the care of maintaining provenance on the manuscript was not carefully considered at the moment.  After the loss of this original effort, things seemed to change.  Copies of copies of copies were made as backups.  

Even now, though, I wonder what happened to the original source files.  Not the lost prepared manuscript or the freshly renewed process to create a new manuscript.  I am referring to the original source files from Joseph's interactions with the celestial.  Were these the important papers that Emma hid under her dress as she crossed the frozen Mississippi River with her children?  Where are they today?  Are they "sealed up" in a vault or were they destroyed by fire?

Interestingly, the Brigham synod claims that there are very few original writings and sermons available of Sidney.  Maybe they do not exist.  Maybe they exist yet are sealed up in an archive.  Maybe they were destroyed.  If a collection of sermons and speeches and writings were available, it would be easy to compare grammar and other linguistic styles to demonstrate Sidney's participation as an author/editor of the Book of Mormon.  

From my understanding, we only have access to two sermon fragments from Sidney.  Both occurred after he and Joseph were tarred and feathered when the printing press was destroyed.  Severely beaten, Sidney was never the same again.  He went through a dark time where he may have tried to kill his wife and would say very bazaar things.  In modern parlance, we may possibly conclude that he suffered from a TBI (traumatic brain injury).  Inhibition was lessoned and he would have what could only be called tirades.  The Salt Sermon is considered to be one such event.  On another occassion, in Nauvoo, he confronted Joseph and his friends for their tom-foolery following a Sunday service.  Pulling out a sword he made an oath and pledge that if they did not stop wrestling he would kill them or die trying.  The two sermons were recorded in the personal journals of Wilford Woodruff and later discovered.  The Salt Sermon was a one-paragraph synopsis reflecting on Sidney's condition more than anything else.  The other sermon was carefully annotated to capture the main themes of Sidney's discourse.

In this sermon, Sidney was given a chance to speak at a large conference - for the first time in a long time.  Sidney reflected on when he first visited the early Joseph Church and emphasized that it was a very small meeting room and only had 40 or so participants.  Sidney then reflected on how he brought 17,000 or more to the movement during the Kirtland era that had grown even more during the time of the sermon (Nauvoo era).  Was Sidney reminding the leadership of his contribution?  Was he reminding Joseph that "when we started out together, you had nothing, except the Ancient Record!  I had a following!  I grew the movement.  Me!"  Sincerely, this is all true.  Sidney brought a large following into the fold.  Sidney implemented significant organizational structures to the simple form the Whitmers had proposed.  And, it would seem, the Sidney faction and the Whitmer faction were not interested in the same things and the Whitmers left the Sidney cluster in Kirtland and later Nauvoo and settled in Missouri.  Two clashing views of what the Church should become.

Sidney's infrastructure empowered the stakes of Zion.  The apostles were called to "go forth" as that is the meaning of the word; they represented the leadership in the mission field where a stake was not yet organized.  Upon the sudden death of Joseph at Carthage, the Brigham faction made several bold moves: disempowering the stake of Nauvoo by reassigning its quorum of 70, restructuring the first presidency and Quorum of Twelve to hold the executive keys.

Now, why would Brigham think he was allowed to make such drastic institutional changes?  Well, from observation and experience, Brigham saw it happen often.  The inner councils, such as the original Council of Fifty, likely discussed this extensively.  It was likely well established at the time that Joseph was Prophet because he brought forth the Ancient Record that got translated into a religious movement via the publication of the Book of Mormon.  

#### Example: Potential Sidney-induced anachronism
An anachronism is something in an ancient text that does NOT correctly fit appropriately in context of the time (chronos) in which it was to have been written.  Many antagonists of the Book of Mormon have created a laundry-list of anachronisms as, it is worth noting, has antagonists to the Bible.  Or antagonists to the Vedic texts.  This is one form of challenging the integrity of scripture while failing to explain away the content-creation itself.

In my estimation, Sidney was the primary co-author and Oliver was the grafter of the two branches into the book product form. The best example of such confluence would be the parable that Jacob shares with his children on the small plates.  Is it a parable of an olive tree in an oliveyard or a vine in a vineyard?  Which are more commonly grafted?  Why would Jacob include it?  Where was the source material and how did it related to the writings of Isaiah that Jacob's brother Nephi included?

America in the 1830s was very anti-Semitic.  The most educated of men would say the most demeaning and racist things about the Jews.  So the Jewish messaging in the Book of Mormon had to be carefully crafted.  At the time, the symbol of Jewery was the olive tree.  Sidney, proclaimed to be very well educated in such matters, likely was ademant that Joseph was mistaken in the original text received.  Recall, these men surrounding Joseph thought he was an idiot; Joseph didn't even know the city of Jerusalem had walls (as later witnessed by his friend, lover and confidant Emma).  Maybe Sidney was a bit condescending and arrogant.  And likely, the parable of the olive tree demonstrated his strong will in pushing through significant edits.  In his worldview, it had to be an olive tree!

Today, a more open-minded reader, could see the original context of the parable as a vine and a vineyard.  Likely, Joseph sent the original text in this form, Sidney made significant edits, and Oliver in attempting to merge the two says "tree" sometimes and "vine" other times.  Or a tree in the vineyard. Confusion in the message ensues.  

Of course, Jacob did not have such confusion because he was living in a time with significantly different worldviews.  Jacob would likely not recognize much of anything that scholars and religious leaders interpret as scripture from antiquity.  So we need to attempt to demonstrate some degree of ethnographic indifference as we answer some important questions.  Why did Jacob include this parable and where did he source the text?  

Recall that Nephi commissioned the small plates to contain "plain and precious truths" for the children.  After examining Nephi's original contribution, few seemed to consider themselves worthy of adding anything.  Jacob, Nephi's younger brother, does choose to add some key teachings.  First, he explains that polyamorous relationships are not as easy.  Maybe Jacob explained how Nephi and his first love would cry together at night as Nephi moved forward with what God had commanded.  This is hard to fully decifer as we have ramblings about David/Solomon and when taking concubines/wives is allowed or not.  In my estimation, a very terse teaching was again over-explained by Sidney or Oliver.

The second major contribution was the inclusion of the parable regarding the grafting of an "olive tree."  Olive trees are everygreens that are related to lilacs and can live to be over a hundred years old.  Wild or natural olive trees (Olea sylvestris) have not been cultivated so they produce small olives with little oil and low yields.  As agriculture develops, artisans try to maximize yields and quality.  For pollen-flora, this is a mixing of pollens of plant varieties to create new varieties.  An evolution of the wild strawberry to the common strawberry of today is a good example of this.

For trees, the common process of hybridization to cultivate or tame the wild is grafting.  Since olive trees take at least 10 years to grow before bearing significant fruit, and up to 40 years before bearing consistent yields, a cultivar can try and graft branches from the tame/cultivated trees into the wild trees hoping to transform the tree to produce at a higher quality.  For Christian scholars, the parable related to grafting olive trees is poetically described in the New Testament (Romans 11) as broken branches being grafted in, wild and natural branches, roots of different trees, and so on.

The final product of Jacob 5 is the parable of an olive tree, but was that the original text?  First, we have a Christian tradition about olive-tree grafting from Romans; certainly Sidney would know this reference as a minister of his era.  Second, the parable itself mixes contexts "an olive tree in a vineyard": should that not be an olive tree in an oliveyard, which is a common expression in the Bible.  Third, the grafting is backwards: one uses the tree systems of an older wild tree and grafts in branches from a tame productive tree.  The Jacob 5 editition suggests that wild branches attached to a tame tree system will create productive outcomes?  Nonsensical!

Taking a step back, what was the parable that Jacob wanted to include that was plain and precious for his children?  Was it an olive tree?  Or a vine?  In context of Nephi's commission and purpose of the small plates,  Jacob would want to build upon what Nephi established.  First, the olive is only mentioned twice in Isaiah and in both instances refers to the gleaning process NOT grafting.  Second the vine is mentioned many times by Isaiah and often refers to the sweet wine from the vine.  Third, a natural grape has a seed, so it can provide both fruit/beverage and an oil: grape-seed oil.  Fourth, the devout [naziri] Hebrews seemed to have restrictions in diet that may have excluded (or included) the use of the grape for sweet wine, strong drink, and oil.  The original guidelines have likely been skewed during the many translations and interpretations of the limited scripture we have; however, Nephi's brother Jacob would have access to the original context on the Brass Plates.
 
Jacob understood that his brother Nephi praised the insights of Isaiah.  Once important Isaiah scripture, Isaiah 5, is a poem or song.  A song about a young vineyard planted on a hill carefully nourished and protected.  Yet, instead of bring forth sweet grapes, the vine brought forth stinky grapes (fox grapes).  Jacob knew this Isaiah passage and as a guardian of the Brass Plates, would likely study them.  And in doing so, I imagine, he found the source of Isaiah's song.  That is, Isaiah's poem was his own but he was referencing what seemed to be a common parable of his era (100+ years before Nephi).  Now, Jacob's inclusion aligns with Nephi's guidelines.  This provides an educational context for the full meaning of the song of Isaiah regarding the beloved's vineyard.

So Jacob shares a parable of how a vine can be grafted to alter the fruit, a practice still very common today.  And maybe this is what Joseph Smith voiced and originally dictated.  However, a strong-minded Sidney may have objected saying "everyone knows that the symbol of Israel is the olive tree" and "look here, in the New Testament, grafting is about olives!"  Now confusion and conflation occurs.  Sidney was imposing his worldview as truth and Oliver interwined both narratives.  And the result is strange:  within a vineyard there is an olive tree, ...

My point is that Jacob's worldview is very different than Sidney's worldview.  One lived in the time, the other was conjecturing what it was like to live in the time.  Any careful examination of pollen records from the Jerusalem era will demonstrate that the olive tree was relatively insignificant until AFTER 200 BC (and had a major down-trend around 5 May 31 AD).  As BH Roberts predicted, science will help reveal the truth of all things.  Interestingly, this may have also been prophesied as "the truth will cry forth from the dust of the earth".  Core samples of sediment from the Dead Sea can reveal much about flora, earthquakes, and climate anomalies.  I would estimate that Jerusalem had a nice climate for vineyards; had a significant climate-change event; and olive trees, more robust in arid conditions, thrived.

#### Lack of internal institutional consistency
Consider for example the most important baptismal prayer:  "Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."  This prayer differs what Yeshua personally established in 3 Nephi:  "Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."  Unless of course, everyone knew there was some artistic inflation in the original narrative.  Further study reveals that Alma baptizing at the Waters of Mormon before the Messiah Death Event used entirely different language.  Among second-generation followers of the Brigham synod, leadership discussed an obvious question within the institutional framework: where and how did Alma get authority to baptize?

Another obvious question is:  why would a "perfect translation" of the Book of Mormon (inferred by the modern polemics anchored to the Article of Faith distinguishing Joseph's work from Biblical translations) not be perfectly followed?  Apologists offer no explanation other than "Joseph changed it."  So the question is:  why would Joseph change it?  Was it one of those edits of Oliver being tricky?  Or something more foundational?

Now consider the lynchpin of the argument.  The description of the doctrine as merely:  faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost with the further distinction that any additions to this doctrine is not the TRUE doctrine.  Today, the believers within the Brigham synod must carefully follow the Word of Wisdom (originally given as counsel not commandment) and must honor the doctrine of the tithe (it is mentioned in 3 Nephi, so it counts, right?) in order to get their version of a Costco card to enter into the exclusive temple and its rites and rituals.  A faithful apologist will anchor to: the "living prophet" updates the doctrine (that Yeshua outlined as needing no update) based on the times and seasons in which we live.  Sadly, that logic is as reliable as some thought conditioning in American novels such as 1984 or Animal Farm.  

One needs to merely review the establishment of the Brigham synod:  Brigham claimed no prophetic authority, personally knew Joseph and understood what a prophet was; rather, Brigham became the President of the Church, consolidated power to maintain control, and decades later, allowed the Church body declare that indeed he was a "prophet, seer, and revelator".

### Summary of Editorialization in Translation Process
The celestial commission seems to have been "bring forth this Ancient American record."  Whether through personal ambitions or through additional directives beyond the primary marvelous work and wonder (singular), Joseph Smith leveraged the novel content in the Ancient American record to craft a religious movement.  Joseph's novel content was an innovation that Sidney could leverage in context of his own desires and ambitions.  Likely, the collaboration was decided when Sidney lost his association with the Baptist group and was rebuilding in Ohio using the Campbellite framework, mixed with his profound beliefs in "infant salvation by grace" that was essential to his person.  Reformationists always have strong beliefs opposing the status quo, but internal beliefs can be as severe and strong as the status quo.  Compare this to Martin Luther's 95 theses against the Catholic tradition, yet his new religious movement would severely punish anyone that was anti-Trinitarian.

When summarizing motivation, one can easily conclude that (1) Joseph wanted to start a religious movement like his uncle did and (2) Sidney wanted to reform the Baptist/Campbellite theocracy to emphasis infant salvation.  Together, they were a force.  Sidney had the logic and rhetoric.  And Joseph had original content which cannot be easily dismissed.  

Sure, we can remove the phrase "And it came to pass" ([ha-yah] palindrome in Hebrew) and we may have a short pamphlet (literary criticism of Samuel Clement, aka, Mark Twain).  My primary thesis would be Mark Twain was correct about the Legend of Nephi at least.  This small record was intended to be "plain and precious" for Nephi's children and posterity.  Due to the circumstances of the lost pages and the desire for Sidney to pontificate his Pauline Trinitarian worldview, this small record became much, much more.  And as a seeker of truth, I would like to separate Nephi's masterpiece from its editorialization.

I am capable of believing that Joseph Smith received an ancient record, and this was written down as an original manuscript.  This does imply that Joseph had some prophetic gifts, that in modern parlance could easily be defined as channelling.  A celestial voice communicated to Joseph and that information was transcribed.  And then reviewed, discussed, debated, and pontificated.  As BH Roberts predicted: a day would come when science would triangulate the veracity of the Ancient American Record.  BH Roberts had a unique position as he had direct access to all of the remnants of the writings of Joseph's time and season that the Brigham synod possessed.  And maybe these primary documents are carefully preserved in a vault.  If so, in full transparency, they should be released.  However, sadly, if past protocols have been preserved, the primary documents were burned.

Yet, as BH Roberts concluded, I am able to embrace my Mormon roots and heritage:  the good, the bad, and the ugly.  It is a cultural heritage into which I was born and raised.  So I will cherish the experience and exploration.  If I had not been prepared with such an upbringing, I could not develop this developing thesis:  the Book of Mormon was a editorialized expansion of an original Ancient American Record.

### Common Problem of Editorialization 
Editorialization is a common problem any time an ancient scripture passes through the hands of a scribe.  More so, when it passes through the hands of a translator.  Consider carefully, the writings of Isaiah.  According to the contents of the Book of Mormon, both Nephi and Yeshua called these writings great.  And one day, we may be able to read them.  For now, we are left with broken/modified renderings.  

Isaiah was given the gift of a quick-tongue and utilized this gift to try and guide the leadership of his day choose the right.  For example, when he takes his young son to examine the conduit that feeds the Gihon spring in the city of Jerusalem, he intentionally encounters King Ahaz and offers unsolicited advice.  He first offers a sign that Ahaz refuses, by telling Ahaz that his betrothed young maiden accompanying him was pregnant with a son who will become a righteous king.  Isaiah counsels with Ahaz that "Syria is confederate with Emphraim" predicting the demise of the Northern Kingdom.  

Taken together, this is a strong Hebraic story.  Confederacy is analagous to a betrothal, a contract that has not been consummated.  A very concrete parallelism.  Isaiah later calls Jerusalem a daughter of Babylon, a harlot.  That is, "Babylon was confederate with Jerusalem" and contractually consummated the bondage.

As Isaiah is reviewed, it needs to be done so carefully, not with modern distortions associated with the broken language and tradition.  For example, the proper names Isaiah uses:  Syria, Babylon, Jerusalem, Zion.  Are they being used specifically or generically.  Consider the prophesy of Isaiah 2, the establishment of Zion and Jerusalem.  As Nephi likened the scriptures unto himself, he recognized this was his calling and made every effort to fulfill it.  After crafting his first ploughshare to move dirt to launch his first ship, Nephi later read the Isaiah scripture and realized he was fulfilling Isaiah's God-given prophecies.  At some point, that may have guided Nephi in his actions.  For Nephi, Zion and Jerusalem would refer to their original meanings: zion representing the scepter and ruling function of society and jerusalem representing the staff and teaching function of society.  Likely Isaiah was part of the MISNE, possibly its leader, and Nephi would have known all of this.  As a remnant of the house of Jacob, Nephi fulfilled many of Isaiah's prophecies.  

The region commonly called the Levant today has had many names.  Abraham, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, was promised a land of inheritance that included the Nile River system, all of Arabia to the borders of the mountains of modern Turkey.  What did the ancients call this region?  Certainly portions of the region were possibly named Egypt and  Canaan (or some derivative), but what was the expression for the entirety of the promise?  The point is that we do not have the worldview of the ancients, so when a term like Babel or Babylon is used, is that in a very local context within the region or does that reflect the entire region.  Such a distinction is important if the ancients accepted polygenesis and did not try to craft a narrative that claimed this one region of the world populated the entirety of the world.

Nephi left the drama of the region and went to an old nation to teach them, and reluctantly rule over them.  He was both the scepter and the staff, both zion and jerusalem.  Nephi was the great KORESH, a title of significance also mentioned in Isaiah.

Geographically, Jerusalem was the buffer between the societies of Egypt and the northern societies:  Syria, Assyria, Babylon (local territory within entire region: city of Babylon in the land of Babylon analagous to the city of Zerahemla in the land of Zerahemla).  Sometimes, like Josiah, a king would have a wife from both regions to help with diplomacy.  Josiah, a "righteous" king, respected his scepter as zion thereby taking counsel from the staff of jerusalem (the MISNE).  When renovating the temple, ancient documents were discovered and Josiah executed the counsel given to him by a prophetess in the MISNE. Within the MISNE, as Nephi teaches us, there were varying viewpoints regarding the correct direction for the house of Jacob in relations with its neighbors.  Both Isaiah and Jeremiah seemed to have a pro-Egypt perspective.  And Nephi's family, being taught in the manner of the Hebrews in the language of Egypt, was likely part of a pro-Egypt perspective.  However, the Egyptian leadership starting with Necho was placed in power by Assyria.  So when Necho marches to fight Babylon, and Josiah intercepts the march, the drama only increases.  A careful reading of this encounter may suggest that a group of KOHEN had established a temple in Elephantine and had taken the Ark of the Covenant which Josiah recovered, dying doing so.  A pro-Egypt perspective in Jerusalem may have had mixed feelings that a splinter-MISNE group removed the Ark of the Covenant from its retirement in the temple of Jehovah that builded Solomon and was taking it to war with Necho.  The primary point being that the palace and temple intrigue was unsustainable and Jerusalem would be destroyed.

Isaiah like Nephi, would have written in a form of Hebrew today called paleo-Hebrew or pre-exilic Hebrew.  That is, the Egyptian glyphs and characters would represent the Hebrew language.  For example, the same glyph would mean "m" in Hebrew and would be one of the glyphs that represented the "n" in Egyptian.  Furthermore, the alphabet was likely more than 22 characters and the diacritics and cantillations were nonexistent.  All in all, if Isaiah were to examine the Great Scroll of Isaiah discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls (dated approximately 100 BC), he would be unable to read it.

Isaiah writes in Hebrew language using Egyptian characters.  Jerusalem falls; the upper-class is taken captive to the city of Babylon for proper re-education where they learn the cuneiform writing system; from which a new Hebrew form develops.  Over time, additional cantillatin markers and diacritics are added to aid the pronunciation of ambiguous character combinations.  To preserve the ancient wisdom, translators convert the paleo-Hebrew (Eyptian characters of Hebrew language) writings of Isaiah into post-exilic Hebrew.  Maybe KHERESH was appropriately identified early on, meaning the Master of the flame/furnance.  As the centuries passed, an ambitious and ignorant translator assumes that Cyrus the King of Persia was maybe the KHERESH Isaiah was describing, it was prophetic!  Yes, KHERESH was a prophetic description by Isaiah, but of Nephi.  Much later, when another translator in Europe applies the false assumption that the earlier translator made, he points out an anachronism: how could Cyrus of Persia be a good guy, anointed by God!  And the beginning of the Deutero-Isaiah philosophy begins.  


KHER-ESH as a two Egyptian roots has many potential meanings.  ESH could mean husband, a man becomes a husband when he embraces the warmth fire of a woman's breasts.  MER in Egyptian generally means "steward of" something whereas KHER in Egyptian generally means "overseer" or "master" or "lord".  The title of KHERESH for Nephi has several layers of meaning.  All very concrete in Hebraic form.  Literally, Nephi is the keeper of the furnace.  He brings foundry technologies to America melting gold, silver, tin, and iron embedded with coal.  And for his people, he is the guardian and protector, the overseer of protecting the family units, symbolized by female breasts.  

Finally, it is worth noting that KHERESH is a placeholder for what Isaiah intended.  Maybe he used a variant (KHEPESH has been found as a potential alternative).  Maybe he used a synonym that was closer to Nephi's name as found in Esdras.  As this is unknown, a placeholder is used with an understanding that more data may require another iteration and update.
