## Book of Mormon as "Translation" of Ancient American Record

There are many that will devoutly pledge to the polemic logic (strongly inferred from Moroni 10 in the Book of Mormon) and further institutionalized as the proselyting logic by Talmage in the 1920s:  if the Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith must have been a prophet, and therefore, the Church he created must be the only TRUE and LIVING Church in all the world.

### Proof the "translation" process included "editorialization"
To begin, the absurdity of the polemics argument will be challenged. What does the bringing forth of an Ancient American Record have to do with the formation of an institution and its veracity?  I do not recall Isaiah saying that "because God spoke to me, I demand everyone to follow me and my teachings as it is the ONE and ONLY TRUE WAY."  That Joseph Smith brought forth an Ancient American Record is a good thing, why conflate the good with the philosophies of men, mingled with scripture and make such an absurd claim?  Sadly, such audacity is very much non-inclusive and antithetical to the ministry of Nephi.

Was the polemic logic introduced intentionally by Sidney Rigdon as rhetoric to leverage the Ancient American Record in order to grow a Church movement?  What if the original farewell message of Moroni was expanded in the editorial process to be more Pauline and less Egyptian/Hebrew in nature?  

#### BH Roberts
Based on the discussions between Talmage and BH Roberts a century later, it does seem like primary-source documents available at that time substantiated that Joseph Smith Jr. received an Ancient American Record which was highly editorialized and expanded by Sidney Rigdon.  Recall, both Talmage and BH Roberts were carefully analyzing every primary-source document available to prepare the 1920 edition.  In addition, Talmage was likely the apostolic oversight on BH Roberts development of the official History of the Church.   BH Roberts likely realized that many of the inner circle during Joseph's lifetime also knew this.  At this decisive moment in the Utah-based Brigham Synod of the Mormon movement, Talmage convinced the leadership to continue with the polemics of Moroni 10, to double-down on the strategy with the missionary effort and release of the 1920 edition of the Book of Mormon.  

Developing throughout his tenure, BH Roberts took a much more reasonable and educated position:  the Ancient American Record was a vehicle used by men (with their philosophies) to develop a religious institution (with which he and his children were culturally attached) that  enables people (hopefully) to develop a relationship with the celestial.  BH Roberts knew that the triangulation of history, archaelogy, and science would demonstrate the veracity of the Ancient American Record.  Did BH Roberts know the underlying text was highly expanded and modified to enable Joseph and Sidney to create a religious movement and institution?

BH Roberts as Church historian had access to every scrap of primary-source documentation: documentation that we do not have access to today, or was destroyed.  So we must conjecture as to why BH Roberts would stand contrary to Church leadership in their polemics strategy.  Maybe there were other manuscript fragments or letters and drafts couriered between Joseph and Sidney, possibly by Parley P. Pratt (who, like Sidney, was officially NOT part of the story until AFTER the publication).  Or maybe Parley's brother Orson (who was later given the opportunity to versify a later edition of the Book of Mormon).  Maybe BH Roberts had the privilege of seeing the original source text Joseph possessed.  Was this "the important papers" Joseph gave to Emma to conceal when she crossed the frozen Mississippi River with her young children?  Or possibly, after synthesizing all the history during his tenure, BH concluded that Joseph's inner circle knew of the true process: Joseph as Prophet had original text with innovative content and in an effort to bring it forth had contacted Sidney to prepare it for publication.  Sidney, a grammarian and minister, likely obliged, yet offered much more than Joseph requested.  

Sidney's ademant and active opposition to the 'Solomon Spalding' accusation is in itself informative.  As is the realities of the Church formation: although Sidney was senior in age and had a better acumen for the institutionalization of the movement, he never claimed seniority to the contributions made by Joseph.  And, of course, Sidney did seek this seniority after the martyrdom of Joseph/Hyrum and poisoning of Don Carlos, but Brigham's preparations for a claim to leadership prevailed among the main body of followers.

Why was the Book of Mormon not emphasized in early sermons by Joseph Smith himself?  Why would exact phrases of the Book of Mormon not be cannonized in the early Church in relationship to doctrinal development and institutional practices; rather revelations would expland or clarify many practices (e.g., the Book of Commandments {D&C})?  Why was Joseph constantly reviewing Oliver's preparation of the "original" and "printer" manuscript?  Such contextual questions will be further explored, but consideration of such questions would explain BH Roberts' personal position:  our religion is our culture and we should continue teaching it to our children as our society; we should invite others to adopt our culture without framing our religion as an absolute truth---even when the day arrives that science will demonstrate the veracity of the Ancient American Record.

Whatever primary-source documents BH Roberts reviewed, he arrived at a reasonable counter-position:  We should be grateful of our ancestral pioneer heritage and embrace the wholeness of Joseph Smith and his movement.  We should embrace the innovativeness with the weaknesses of the man and his followers.  We should NOT push a polemic position of absolutist rhetoric regarding the Church itself.  Rather, we should offer that our religion is "a way, a life, and a truth" NOT "the only way, the only life, and the only truth".   Maybe I am over-extending BH's conclusions.  Maybe.  I would conclude the BH wanted Mormonism to be less polemic and more inclusive; more humility and less hubris with such polemic claims.  At the same time, BH believed that the veracity of the Ancient American Record would be demonstrated using science and reasoning.  I suspect that BH realized that such a demonstration of the source-text veracity would require a reveal of the editorialization that occurred during the preparation phase of the Book of Mormon.


#### Joseph Smith's *singular* task 
In this frame, God gave Joseph Smith Jr. a single marvelous work and wonder as a task: to bring forth the Ancient American Record.  Joseph likely was motivated for more, and asked for it.  So God gave Joseph what he wanted (ask and ye shall receive), allowing Joseph to learn how the philosophies of man will mingle with scripture to distort the truth and imbue instututional powers (D&C 121).  Or said differently, "You will learn dear Joseph, that men will honor Me with their lips, but remove their hearts from Me."  Interestingly, it would seem that Joseph learned this lesson.  His speech when the manuscript (not the original text) was sealed up in the corner of the Nauvoo House suggests this collaborative process with scribes and editors was the "bane of his existence".  And it is highly likely the mob of Carthage was associated with the power structures within the movement that wanted to shut off the valve of innovative content and move forward by stabilizing the formidable institutional movement and its doctrine.  With Joseph constantly adding new innovative ideas, institualization and stabilization was not likely.  And maybe Joseph's accelerating transcending worldview would be too much.  Rather than allow the founder to kill the movement, killing the founder may have been rationalized to save the movement.

Maybe if Joseph had died sooner, it would have been without this potential Mahan involvement from within.  Perhaps the mob of Missouri was intended to take his life with David Patten at the Battle of Crooked River in 1838 (there was an interesting exchange between David and Joseph preceding the battle; David proclaimed that he felt like he was going to his death as a martyr; Joseph replied something like 'be careful what you wish for'; after David was gut shot, he was taken home and put to bed; no surgeries were attempted on the torso as such things were considered blasphemous among devout Christians of this era; Joseph stayed with David and his family until David died; maybe all of this was a teaching moment from the heavens for Joseph, a preparation of sorts).  Or maybe Alexander Doniphane was NOT supposed to step in and save his life.  Maybe it would have been better for the Missouri mob to perform its deed of martyrdom in 1838.  Certainly that would have been a significant change-point in the Mormon movement.

When Joseph was 37 years old, 30 days [January 1843], he gave a very interesting sermon about the circle of life and returning to the dust of the earth.  And maybe God had been giving Joseph time to make this choice.  Less than 18 months later, Joseph and Hyrum were on a ferry crossing the Mississippi with an inner circle of friends (and likely at least one spy).  They were heading to the Rocky Mountains to start afresh, to leave the God-forsaken country so that a new government could be formed in unchartered lands.  A new Zion.  A new Jerusalem.  A new United Order.  Seemingly, Joseph and Hyrum together decided that they should return to Carthage.  And so, when Joseph finally faced the music, it was his choice.  The brothers asked for the ferry to be turned around, loaded some pistols, and headed to Carthage for their moment of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  If you carefully follow the logic, the Rocky Mountains would never be a safe haven for the brothers as the opposition within the Mormon movement would follow them there.  They had lived interesting lives and it would seem the heavens had prepared them for Carthage.  A form of fate intermingled with the agency of all parties involved.


#### Situational Context Enabling Editorialization
The young Joseph Smith Jr., according to the official timeline, received celestial visitations on September 21, 1823.  Was that Saturday night, September 20th into Sunday early AM, September 21st? Or more likely Sunday into Monday as they returned to work the next morning.  Regardless of the minutiae, these "visitations of angels" occurred during the [FULL moon phase](https://nineplanets.org/moon/phase/9-20-1823/) and near the fall equinox.

The Book of Mormon was published on March 26, 1830 (~5 days after a spring equinox).  Between these time posts (September 1823 and March 1830), the Ancient Record had to be retrieved, original text had to be dictated and edited and prepared for publication.  The printer made note how the prepared manuscript (internally called by believers the "original manuscript" copied as the "printer's manuscript) had little punctuation and many run-on sentences.  

- Critical analysis of the location of run-on sentence density and poor grammar and punctation will very likely reveal that certain segments of text seemed to have fewer problems.  I would set forth as a proposition that many of the so-called speeches of the Book of Mormon meet this criteria.  That is, Moroni 10 had fewer grammar and punctuation errors since it included a significant expansion by the grammarian [Sidney Rigdon](http://sidneyrigdon.com/RigWrit1.htm).

What is essential to the internal narrative was to thwart the "Solomon Spalding" rumor as the original source for the contents of the Book of Mormon.  Although a careful examination will find this specific accusation lacking in evidence, the nature of the argument had merit:  original source plus expansion.  The key point is that the early Church considered the accusation worthy of thwarting.  And furthermore, the accusation suggested that there was an underlying original text that was edited and prepared into the final manuscript.

- Sidney Rigdon was a RedStone Baptist removed from this association for pushing "infancy salvation"; thereafter, Sidney infiltrated a large Campbellite following and was seeking "new gospel material" to grow his ministry in alignment with his internal belief system.  This is a key data point regarding "Solomon Spalding".  And very likely, as you consider the Pauline Baptist contents interlaced throughout the 1830 Book of Mormon, Sidney Rigdon was a co-author with Joseph Smith Jr.; Oliver was merely a scribal secretary that was responsible for merging the two threads into one coherent manuscript.

Once you can recognize the intentional efforts to leverage the Ancient American Record to grow a church movement, the ability to identify the Pauline Baptist Campbellite Ridgon philosophies are much more plausible.  For antagonists, this fine point is irrelevant; the baby goes out with the bathwater.  For apologists, this potential reality is NOT comfortable.  Yet, this may be a way forward.  A way to fulfill the prophetic counsel offered in D&C 123:  to waste and wear out our lives to bring the truth from the darkness for the benefit of our children.  Cosmic irony at its best.  And a cosmic lesson regarding entropy of mediocrity for self-preservation of institutional norms.  The antithesis of innovative frames. 

#### Motivation to leverage Ancient Record to grow a Church
The Church has gone through several institutional changes: (1) the ideal organization of Joseph Smith, (2) the Whitmer influence, (3) the Rigdon influence, (4) the Brigham synod with smaller schism movements, (5) the Talmage polemics, (6) the Hinckley bureaucracy, (7) the Nelson era with its repetitive messaging: 'trust leadership' and 'hold fast to the iron rod'.

Joseph Smith, Jr. had an uncle who started a religious movement (Lucy's brother Jason) after having adventures on the high seas (possible source of the idea for Joseph Smith, Sr.: grow gingseng and sell to China) and losing the 'love of his life' so retreating into the northeast and starting a commune.  Why is this relevant data point overlooked?  

When Joseph Smith, Jr. did initiate the Church, he communicated that he wanted it to be a "religion without creeds" and was immediately under pressure by those around him to outline official creeds.  Olivery Cowdery had a draft of 8 such creeds that Joseph Smith was well aware of in 1830 but would not adopt (or be forced to adopt by institutional pressures) until over a decade later (1842 Wentworth letter where 13 Articles of Faith were canonized).  As I recollect, Joseph attended a early Church service with Oliver where a member of the congregation felt moved by the spirit and in what we would term modernly a Pentecostal moment, the man swung from the rafters singing praises, speaking in tongues, until he hit his head severely and was unconscious for a time.  Oliver likely turned to Joseph and reminded him that creeds were a necessary evil.

#### Whitmer Context
The Whitmer home was where the most important translation occurred, the final effort of the creation stage: the small plates of Nephi.  Mother Whitmer was milking the cow when Brother Nephi appeared to her as a normal man and showed her these records; she was likely the first witness of this physical Ancient American Record.  Yet, she was a woman, so in 1830s America, her testimony as the first witness was excluded (which later 'disappointed' the satirist Samuel Clemens).


As 8 is greater than 3, this second record was the entire purpose of the first record.  The former was a training and trial period, the latter was the main event.

Mother Whitmer would have been exhausted taking care of the men staying with her.  This describes the nature of the environment of the Whitmer home.  Joseph would receive some original text of the Ancient American Record, and the men would spend hours pouring over every word and philosophizing on its meaning and implication.  No time for helping with the chores.  The crop had been planted, 'so bring us some food woman, we are getting hungry utilizing our cerebral matter and vocal systems.'

This tradition of 'man-speculation' would continue throughout Joseph's life.  For example, Joseph introduced a Mormon concept of "outer darkness".  Is this analagous to "black holes" or "dark matter/energy" theorized by modern scientists yet described in the language and understanding of Joseph?  Next, add the relationship of "outer darkness" to the concept of "sons of perdition".  The content was obviously unique and innovative and lead to discussions within the early Mormon movement.  Specific to this topic, most concluded at the time that it would be impossible for there to be a "daughter of perdition" (for reasons unknown that may tie to other innovative content Joseph had shared about the genders).    

Influenced by the worldviews of the Whitmers (Father/Mother, David/Peter, Oliver/Elizabeth Ann, Hiram Page/Catherine, Christian/Jacob/John), a basic organization began the Church with Joseph and Oliver as First Elders.  No one doubted Joseph was a prophet because the content he was creating was new, novel, and inspiring.  However, in the Whitmer era, that did not mean the institution should have hierarchy; there would be lots of Elders equal in the eyes of God; Joseph and Oliver happened to be the first such Elders.  

Joseph would later form an idea for a School of the Prophets with an inclusive definition as anyone with the "spirit of testimony of Jesus" which again would get hampered to be a men-only organization.  This effort to include the fairer sex may explain why so many women of the early Church were so enamored with him; he was trying to give them a place of equality within the religion; in fact, their own body of religious service (the Relief Society).  Maybe Joseph was trying to restore the ancient MISNE which can be interpreted as college or school of the prophets and prophetesses.  The most important remnant of this ancient institution was the story of King Josiah who received counsel from the prophetess Huldah, the keeper of the wardrobe within the MISNE (mish-nay) and followed her spiritual direction exactly.  1830s America was not interested in such things within an institutional religion, but such views would enamore the feminine with Joseph's vision of God's Church.

Hiram Page witnesses this translation phenomenon that Joseph performs and wanted to give it a try (after the publication of the Book of Mormon) using his own personal seer stone (Hiram married into the Whitmer family and he and many of the Whitmers had such stones: the countryside was littered with earthwork mounds and small, round stones were commonly found on or within them).  After Hiram's success, Joseph is anxious, and after carefully consideration, convinces the core group to destroy the Hiram stone and burn the Hiram revelation.  And so begins the natural gravities of power formation.  The concept of equality did not last long.  Only Joseph is allowed to receive such celestial messages for the Church movement.

As Sidney would later gain power in the inner circle of the Mormon movement when he and his followers officially enter the Mormon sphere, it would seem that the Whitmer faction lost power.  Sidney would develop sophisticated institutional structure during the Kirtland/Nauvoo era.  As a result of this power struggle between two idealogies (simple vs complex organizational structure), the Whitmer group volunteered to establish the Mormon movement in Missouri.  In fact, they were very astute in purchasing significant tracts of property early in the settlement enabling them to sell to others of the Mormon movement who would arrive later while preventing a  speculation bubble and runaway property-spikes in price.  And yet, they were disowned by the Kirtland/Nauvoo group because they wanted a reasonable return on investment.  Wisdom from one perspective is perceived as greed from another.


Taking a step back, how did Joseph and the Whitmers become so strongly connected?  The connection was likely through Oliver Cowdery, who would marry into the Whitmer family in 1832.  What relationship did Oliver have with the family to even consider writing a letter to see if their home could be used for finalizing the translation (~1829)?   And how did Oliver become part of the narrative? Hyrum Smith.  Hyrum was Joseph's older brother and was a member of the local school board which hired Oliver Cowdery.  In fact, the brother of Oliver was hired but could not perform the duties so Oliver was the replacement.  Such a data point may be factually true, or may be a contrived narrative to help Oliver get a job in the area and make the entire Church-building process more palatable.  


#### Hyrum Smith's prominence, education, and connections
Regardless, the data remains that Hyrum Smith had some local prominence to get Oliver Cowdery placed as a teacher in Manchester.  Oliver was also involved in treasure-seeking using a divining rod, so maybe the Smith boys crossed paths with him previously.  Hyrum Smith was also well-educated for this rural setting having attended a school in his teens on the campus of Dartmouth College; seemingly, Hyrum stayed behind in Vermont to attend school for a few years while the family moved to Palmyra following Joseph's bone surgery.   Joseph's childhood was full of agitation and unease.  
  

Dartmouth College had some of the first doctors openly practicing non-wartime surgery in 1800s America.  The "bone surgery" story of Joseph's youth demonstrates that: (1) Lucy Mack had money to pay doctors for their constant visits (twenty total doctors participated in Joseph's diagnosis and treatment), (2) Joseph would spend significant time in medical settings and therefore would have advanced access to the belief systems of these doctors, (3) Lucy Mack was convinced to perform a surgery on her son based on limited evidence (and even modern uncertainty) being assured that a leg surgery did not have the same spiritual consequence as a surgery in the human core (which was considered spiritual blaspheme among Christians at the time which was the primary reason Alvin would later die), (4) Joseph's typhoidal (more likely syphilic) condition is a cosmic tie-in to the "sore curse" described in the Book of Mormon that could turn a man or woman black down there (the genitalia region commonly called shame in the 1830s), (5) the shame of Joseph's condition would enable the doctors to manipulate a good Christian woman to spend money and try experimental surgery.

What seems to be lacking from the preparation narrative of the manuscript are the details of Hyrum Smith's role in the process.  Five years senior to Joseph, Hyrum was an older brother that intentionally returned to Carthage to be with his brother at the end.  Certainly, Hyrum would have been significantly involved during the mansucript preparation.  He was, after all one of the eight witnesses where 8 > 3.  That is, Hyrum Smith was at the Whitmer home on July 2, 1829 to be a witness for the small record.

#### Provenance failure with initial effort  
During the initial manuscript-creation process, the first portion of the creation was lost when Joseph loaned Martin Harris the only copy of the prepared manuscript in its polished form.  Martin significantly financed the entrepreneurial enterprise.  Martin already helped Joseph by giving him $50 so Joseph could move.  In addition, Martin had promised to finance a significant portion of the printing costs of the first edition of the Book of Mormon.  Martin mortgaged some property as collateral and would turn a very healthy profit once the Book of Mormon was published and sold.

Again, this classic narrative of the "lost 116 pages" has key data points that are largely ignored.  The first is:  why would Martin even consider asking if others were not doing the same?  If you review the history carefully, before the  6 April 1830 formal and official church formation (with a legal business license and everything), missionaries were called to share the good news of the Messianic visit to Ancient America.  One such missionary was Joseph's brother Don Carlos.  These missionaries would show up at the "translation shack" and copy portions from a source text (mostly 3 Nephi) and would share these fragments to interested parties as evidence of what is coming.   A basic marketing tactic of trial before purchase likely to secure pre-orders for the book.  It is estimated that before 6 April, over 1700 had already been baptized into the movement.   After the formalities of 6 April, Joseph suggested they get "re-baptized" (Joseph did not have an anchor like many established ministers of "one baptism").  Of interest is the question:  where are these scraps of paper?  To a devout believer, these fragments would be highly valued.  Maybe the vault of a Mormon synod keeps them under lock and key, but if you follow the protocol of the era, the reality is likely a bit more mundane.  Joseph Smith would have required the scraps be collected and burned BEFORE the interested party could receive the entire book.  

A second key data point is:  where was the source material used in the attempt to recreate the lost pages?  The official narrative is that Joseph tried to recraft the lost portion which mostly consisted of the Book of Lehi with a few chapters about Mosiah/Benjamin.  God inspired Joseph to stop because the ability to achieve something exactly the same was impossible.  Of course it is!  Have you ever written a long treatise and lose the entire document.  It is gut wrenching!  The next draft will deviate significantly from the original draft.  But to a group of men with mediocre education and a belief that the devil was trying to thwart their work and that lesser men will think lesser of the work if compared, their thinking process makes complete sense.  This just informs us as to the logical frame of Joseph and his inner circle.  

Next, to do such a recreation, it is very likely they had original notes (which I will call the TRUE original text).  To me, this is an important anchor to the veracity of some ancient source material.  Joseph and his editors had source material (that seemingly Joseph provided) that was editorialized.  This means that it was verbosely expanded and improved upon to be (what this group considered to be) both elegant and intelligent.  Objectively, such editorialization would best be described as a Biblical English menagerie of vernacular that was 30 years behind the times (possibly considered cutting age by this rural middle class).  

The "Benjamin/Mosiah" edit may represent one example that demonstrates that an original source text exists that could be referenced.  In 1837, Joseph Smith changed Mosiah 21:28 from Benjamin to Mosiah.  How would Joseph Smith know this needed to be corrected?  Did the heavens directly reveal this?  Or did he review some texts in his possession?  In 1847 (after Joseph had died), Benjamin was changed to Mosiah in Ether 4:1.  Again, what reference material was used to make this decision?  Was there a revelation?  Was careful internal consistency considered?  Or was there an external text that could be reviewed for clarity?  Interestingly, Royal Skousen, without access to any external text, believes no changes should have been made; that is, to trust the perceived original transmission from the celestial.  This position is the most consistent and accurate if you believe in the "inerrancy of scripture" and that editorialization was not part of the translation process.  It would seem, however, that early Mormon followers had a less rigid belief.  This may suggest that everyone within the inner circle knew that there was a primary and core Ancient American Record embellished for readability.

Furthermore, some of the good content was not being included because Martin Harris lost the first portion of the manuscript.  In an effort to "beat the devil at his game" (again an ignorant perspective because if you are playing the devil's game, you have already lost), the good content was carefully sprinkled back into the manuscript as possible.  If you read the legend of Nephi carefully (1 Nephi and 2 Nephi), several times an introjection is made:  "I Nephi will tell my story, but let me get back to my father's story first."  

And of course, if you can buy a few mummies and ancient papyrus, what a great way to include other fragments from the original "lost pages" (the Book of Abraham) or just claim you received it by inspiration as you began translating the Old Testament (the Book of Moses).  Et oila!  A Pearl of Great Price!

Since the legend of Nephi was written last, the text had to be massaged to fit in the existing manuscript and a transition was needed from the small plates to the lost portion of the Mosiah narrative.  Likely the Words of Mormon had a few extra phrases added to clarify what was lost.  That is, Mormon had included the Book of Lehi, and some additional content (currently unknown) that picks up again with Mosiah.  As a curator of history, Mormon would have likely included details from the large plates regarding the life of Nephi (after the death of Lehi), general details about the society after Nephi died with an explanation why the righteous group needed an American Moses (Mosiah) to lead them to out of danger to safety.  And then, Mormon discovers the small plates and adds an addendum, the Words of Mormon.  Likely very brief:  "I finished my work.  I found the small plates of Nephi, so I also include them.  They are very good.  Better than anything I could create, so let me include them as-is."   Any additional transitional clarifications would be inclusions added by the editorial team.  That is, this is a natural transition-element of the original text, let's include some information we possess that was part of the "lost pages" to help with the 2 Nephi to Mosiah transition.  Five years later, when the 'lost manuscript' is never revealed, additional content is added to the Church knowledge stores: writings of Moses and Abraham, which eventually become cannonized as a Pearl of Great Price.

Finally, the edits were intentional for building a religious movement in the 1830s.  That is, the original text said X which was massaged into X'Y to present a favorable message that could be adopted in that era.  Some possible clues of such changes are found in 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi:  (1) a conflation of the "parents" where the man is the visionary and the woman complains (immediate and long-term inconsistencies {stripling sons}); (2) the removal of the narrative about the Ark of the Covenant and its relationship to (a) the negotiations with Laban, (b) the appearance of the Liahona, and (c) the need for a temple in America; (3) the removal of other key ideas that would be ridiculed in 1830s America: the name Colon-mbia and 2100 year prophecy, the word America the Bountiful (or Beautiful), ...

#### Sidney involvement
Next, overlay the Sidney variable.  Sidney was older than Joseph Smith.  Sidney already had experience as a sanctioned member of a Baptist association.  Sidney was known for his careful use of language and was a stickler for grammar (as he studied/understood it: Biblical English that was common during the revolutionary war but was antiquated by the 1820s).  

Sidney fervently believed that "infant children were saved through the grace of Jesus" whether or not they received a baptism.  Ask yourself:  are you capable of considering the possibility that much of the Book of Moroni were Sidney sermons?  How would you feel if Sidney expanded the terse into a self-perceived opus of Pauline Christianty?  That is, Moroni wrote a letter in his succinct/concrete Egyptian (reformed) language and Sidney interpreted, edited, and expanded the letter based on Church-building motivations.  With this possible frame, I invite you to read Moroni 8 again.  And if you do so with real intent, ...  (lol)

When Sidney was dismissed from his Baptist association for his strong views on "infant salvation", he was looking for a way back into the ministry and had ambitions to grow his world views within a religious movement.  During this time (1823-1826), Sidney was being approached by people with new and novel religious ideas.  Seemingly, Sidney would entertain such audiences.

Few specificis are known about Joseph's activities during his preparation to receive the plates.  Joseph was likely working on the family property and continuing his outsourcing activities of digging wells, searching for gold, and such.  Geographically, Joseph and Sidney were separated by 200 or so miles (Manchester to Pittsburg).  Did they meet during this time?  Was an emissary sent (like Martin Harris was sent to Luther Bradish, Charles Anthon, and Samuel Mitchill)?  And if so, would they have devised a strategy of collaboration that would distance themselves until the opportune moment?  Sidney does NOT officially enter into the Mormon flock until about six months after the publication of the Book of Mormon and the official formation of the Church of Latter-day Saints.  Was that natural progression or contrived?

If we had a collection of Sidney writings and sermons, modern linguistic analysis would easily demonstrate Sidney's contributions to the formation of the manuscript that would be published as the Book of Mormon.  Certainly, Joseph was also contributing innovative content to this endeavor.  Sidney seemed to be uninterested in much of the minutiae Joseph provided, but loved inserting sermons that demonstrated his understanding of Christianity based on his internal belief system.  

If accurate, this implies that Joseph's contribution did exist.  Where did Joseph get the innovative content?  My estimation is that Joseph would channel:  find a way to focus and tune into a celestial signal (looking into a hat analagous to the tuning a radio dial), commune with Jehovah, and voice what was heard.  A review of "personal writings" and specifically sections 121-123 in Liberty (with intermittent breaks) informs this channeling proposition.

Considering the possibility of Joseph-Sidney collaboration, things begin to fit together more coherently.  If there were courier-exchanges of different portions of the manuscript intentionally separated by distance, there would need to be an executive secretary that would synthesis the edits into a common manuscript (Oliver Cowdery).  And if Martin Harris witnessed some of these courier transactions, this would give him the impetus to ask permission to also courier the manuscript for a time.  He was financing the endeavor!  Just as Don Carlos was taking fragments to convince the unbelieving, Martin wanted to show his wife what he was investing in.  Seemingly, the care of maintaining provenance on the manuscript was not carefully considered at the moment.  After the loss of this original effort, things seemed to change.  Copies of copies of copies were made as backups.  

Even now, though, I wonder what happened to the original source.  Not the lost prepared manuscript or the freshly renewed process to create a new manuscript.  I am referring to the original source transcriptions from Joseph's interactions with the celestial.  Were these the important papers that Emma hid under her dress as she crossed the frozen Mississippi River with her children?  Where are they today?  Are they "sealed up" in a vault or were they destroyed by fire?


#### Sidney sermons for comparison
Interestingly, the Brigham synod claims that there are very few original writings and sermons available of Sidney.  Maybe they do not exist.  Maybe they exist yet are sealed up in an archive.  Maybe they were destroyed.  If a collection of sermons and speeches and writings were available, it would be easy to compare grammar and other linguistic styles to demonstrate Sidney's participation as an author/editor of the Book of Mormon.  

From my understanding, we only have access to two sermon fragments from Sidney.  Both occurred after he and Joseph were tarred and feathered when the printing press was destroyed.  Severely beaten, Sidney was never the same again.  He went through a dark time where he may have tried to kill his wife and would say very bazaar things.  In modern parlance, we may possibly conclude that he suffered from a TBI (traumatic brain injury).  Inhibition was lessened and he would have what could only be called tirades.  The Salt Sermon is considered to be one such event.  On another occassion, in Nauvoo, he confronted Joseph and his friends for their tom-foolery following a Sunday service.  Pulling out a sword he made an oath and pledge that if they did not stop wrestling he would kill them or die trying.  

The two sermon fragments available were recorded in the personal journals of Wilford Woodruff and later discovered.  The Salt Sermon was a one-paragraph synopsis reflecting on Sidney's condition more than anything else: "You are all sinners and damned to hell!".  The other sermon was carefully annotated to capture the main themes of Sidney's discourse.

In this sermon, Sidney was given a chance to speak at a large conference - for the first time in a long time.  Sidney reflected on when he first visited the early Joseph Church and emphasized that it was a very small meeting room and only had 40 or so participants.  Sidney then reflected on how he brought 17,000 or more to the movement during the Kirtland era that had grown even more during the time of the sermon (Nauvoo era).  Throughout the day of the conference, Sidney would return to the pulpit and continue his sermon.  Maybe he was quite unwell and would tire easily.  After 2-3 segments of his sermon, Sidney sat down to rest.  And did not return to speak for the rest of the day or the rest of the conference.  Hyrum Smith seemed to fill time reminding everyone to contribute to the efforts of the Relief Society as if Mary Fielding had given him a nudge.

Was Sidney tired or was leadership tired of hearing what the sermon was suggesting?  Was Sidney reminding the leadership of his contribution?  Was he reminding Joseph that "when we started out together, you had nothing, except the Ancient Record!  I had a following!  I grew the movement.  Me!"  Sincerely, this is all true.  Sidney brought a large following into the movement.  Sidney implemented significant organizational structures to the simple form the Whitmers had proposed.  And, it would seem, the Sidney faction and the Whitmer faction were not interested in the same things and the Whitmers left the Sidney cluster in Kirtland and later Nauvoo and settled in Missouri.  Two clashing views of what the Church should become.

Sidney's infrastructure empowered the stakes of Zion.  The apostles were called to "go forth" as that is the meaning of the word; they represented the leadership in the mission field where a stake was not yet organized.  Apostles had limited power within established stakes.   Upon the sudden death of Joseph at Carthage, the Brigham faction made several bold moves: disempowering the stake of Nauvoo by reassigning its quorum of 70, restructuring the first presidency and Quorum of Twelve to hold the executive keys thereby empowering apostles thereafter regardless of stake infrastructures.

Now, why would Brigham think he was allowed to make such drastic institutional changes?  Well, from observation and experience.  Brigham saw it happen often.  The inner councils, such as the original Council of Fifty, likely discussed change extensively.   And Joseph as an innovator was constantly introducing changes: some were adopted, some were altered, some were ignored.

#### Sidney-induced anachronism?
An anachronism is something in an ancient text that does NOT correctly fit appropriately in context of the time (chronos) in which it was to have been written.  Many antagonists of the Book of Mormon have created a laundry-list of anachronisms.  It is worth noting, antagonists of the Bible use this same technique.  Or antagonists of the Vedic texts.  This approach challenges the integrity of scripture but fails to 'explain away' the content-creation itself.

In my estimation, Sidney was the primary co-author and Oliver was the grafter of the two branches into the book product form. The best example of such confluence would be the parable that Jacob shares with his children on the small plates.  It is a parable of grafting:  an olive tree in an oliveyard or a vine in a vineyard?  

Well, which is it?  Olives or Grapes?  And why would Nephi's brother Jacob include it?

America in the 1830s was very anti-Semitic.  The most educated of men would say the most demeaning and racist things about the Jews.  So the Jewish messaging in the Book of Mormon had to be carefully crafted.  At the time, the symbol of Jewery was the olive tree.  Sidney, proclaimed to be very well educated in such matters, likely was ademant that Joseph was mistaken in the original text received.  Recall, these men surrounding Joseph thought he was an idiot; Joseph didn't even know the city of Jerusalem had walls (as later witnessed by his friend, lover and confidant Emma).  Maybe Sidney was a bit condescending and arrogant.  And likely, the parable of the olive tree demonstrated his strong will in pushing through significant edits.  In his worldview, it had to be an olive tree!

Today, a more open-minded reader, could see the original context of the parable as a vine and a vineyard.  Likely, Joseph conveyed the original text in this form, Sidney made significant edits, and Oliver in attempting to merge the two says "tree" sometimes and "vine" other times.  Or a tree in the vineyard. Confusion in the message ensues.  

Of course, Nephi's brother Jacob did not have such confusion because he was living in a time with significantly different worldviews.  Jacob would likely not recognize much of anything that scholars and religious leaders interpret as scripture from antiquity.  So we need to attempt to demonstrate some degree of ethnographic/ethnomethodological indifference as we answer some important questions.  Why did Jacob include this parable and where did he source the text?  

Recall that Nephi commissioned the small plates to contain "plain and precious truths" for the children.  After examining Nephi's original contribution, few guardians of the plates thereafter seemed to consider themselves worthy of adding anything.  Jacob, Nephi's younger brother, does choose to add some key teachings.  First, he explains that polyamorous relationships are not easy.  Maybe Jacob explained how Nephi and his first love (?Moron or ?Alma) would cry together at night as Nephi moved forward with what God had commanded.  This is difficult to fully decifer as we have ramblings about David/Solomon and when taking concubines/wives is allowed or not.  In my estimation, a very terse teaching was again over-explained by Sidney and/or Oliver.

The second major contribution from Jacob was the inclusion of the parable regarding the grafting of an "olive tree."  Olive trees are evergreens that are related to lilacs and can live to be over a hundred years old.  Wild or natural olive trees (Olea sylvestris) have not been cultivated so they produce small olives with low yields resulting in little oil.  As agriculture develops, artisans try to maximize yields and quality.  By removing blossoms, fewer fruit will develop, but each fruit will be larger.  By pruning the branches, optimality may also improve.  These effect are not generational.  For long-term effects, breeding experiments are performed:  seeds, seedlings, or grafting.   

For pollen-flora, this often occurs by mixing pollens of plant varieties to create new varieties or increase the quality/yields of existing varieties (natural seed manipulation).  An evolution of the wild strawberry to the common strawberry of today is a good example of this.  For trees, the common process of hybridization to cultivate (tame the wild) is grafting.  Self-pollinating trees (peaches, nectarines, apricots) or gendered trees (date palms) can also be grafted to manipulate the fruit produced.   

Since olive trees take at least 10 years to grow before bearing significant fruit, and up to 40 years before bearing consistent yields, a cultivar can try and accelerate time-to-yield by grafting branches from the tame/cultivated trees into the wild trees hoping to transform the tree to produce at a higher quality.  For Christian scholars, the parable related to grafting olive trees is poetically described in the New Testament (Romans 11) as broken branches being grafted in, wild and natural branches, roots of different trees, and so on.

The final product of Jacob 5 is a parable of an olive tree, but was that the original text?  First, we have a Christian tradition about olive-tree grafting from Romans; certainly Sidney would know this reference as a minister of his era.  Second, the Jacob 5 parable itself mixes contexts "an olive tree in a vineyard": should that not be an olive tree in an oliveyard, which is a common expression in the Bible.  Third, the grafting is backwards: one uses the tree systems of an older wild tree and grafts in branches from a tame productive tree.  The Jacob 5 edition suggests that wild branches attached to a tame tree system will create productive outcomes?  For olives, this is not possible.  For vines, it may be possible.

Taking a step back, what was the parable that Jacob wanted to include that was plain and precious for his children?  Was it an olive tree?  Or a vine?  In context of Nephi's commission and purpose of the small plates,  Jacob would want to build upon what Nephi established.  Jacob understood that his brother Nephi praised the insights of Isaiah.    First, the olive is only mentioned twice in Isaiah and in both instances refers to the gleaning process NOT grafting.  Second, the vine is mentioned many times by Isaiah and often refers to the sweet wine from the vine.  Third, a natural grape has a seed, so it can provide both fruit/beverage and an oil: grape-seed oil.  Fourth, the devout [naziri] Hebrews seemed to have restrictions in diet that may have excluded (or included) the use of the grape for sweet wine, strong drink, and oil.  The original guidelines have likely been skewed during the many translations and interpretations of the limited scripture we have; however, Nephi's brother Jacob would have access to a more original context on the brass plates.
 
One important Isaiah scripture, Isaiah 5, is a poem or song, something Nephi included in the Isaiah-readings section of the small plates (2 Nephi 15).  A song about a young vineyard planted on a hill carefully nourished and protected. Yet, instead of bringing forth sweet grapes, the vine brought forth stinky grapes (fox grapes).   No mention of olives or olive trees.  Jacob knew this Isaiah passage and as a guardian of the brass plates, would likely study them.  And in doing so, I imagine, Jacob found the source of Isaiah's song.  That is, Isaiah's poem was his own but he was referencing what seemed to be a common parable of his era (100+ years before Nephi) that was transformed into a simple, primary song.  Now, Jacob's inclusion aligns with Nephi's guidelines.  This provides an educational context for the full meaning of the song of Isaiah regarding the beloved's vineyard.  A meaning that will unlock the "polygenesis" view of creation.

So Jacob shares a parable of how a vine can be grafted to alter the fruit, a practice still very common today.  And maybe this is what Joseph Smith voiced and was originally dictated.  However, a strong-minded Sidney may have objected saying "everyone knows that the symbol of Israel is the olive tree" and "look here, in the New Testament, grafting is about olives!"  Now confusion and conflation occurs.  Sidney was imposing his worldview as truth and Oliver interwined both narratives.  And the result is strange:  within a vineyard there is an olive tree, ...

My point is that Jacob's worldview is very different than Sidney's worldview.  One lived nearer the time of Isaiah/Zenos, the other was conjecturing what it was like to live in the time.  Any careful examination of pollen records from the Jerusalem area will demonstrate that the olive tree was relatively significant BEFORE 2000 BC, relatively insignificant from 2000BC-200BC, and again significant AFTER 200 BC which may demonstrate climate change in the Levant: arid, less arid, back to arid.  The vineyard represents a more pleasant, less arid environment whereas the oliveyard represents a less pleasant, more arid environment.  As BH Roberts predicted, science will help reveal the truth of all things.  Interestingly, this may have also been prophesied as "the truth will cry forth from the dust of the earth".  Core samples of sediment from the Dead Sea can reveal much about flora, earthquakes, and climate anomalies.  I would estimate that Jerusalem had a nice climate for vineyards during the Solomonic era (read Songs of Solomon to verify, lol).  At some point, a significant climate-change event occured; thereafter, olive trees, more robust in arid conditions, thrived.

#### Lack of internal institutional consistency
Consider for example the most important baptismal prayer:  "Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."  This prayer differs from what Yeshua personally established in 3 Nephi:  "Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."  Unless of course, everyone knew there was some artistic inflation in the published narrative.  

Further study reveals that Alma baptizing at the Waters of Mormon before the Messiah Death Event used entirely different language.  Among second-generation followers of the Brigham synod, leadership discussed an obvious question within the institutional framework: where and how did Alma get authority to baptize?  Did Alma already have it?  Did Abinadi give it to him?  How could the institutional chain-of-command be demonstrated in the story of Alma?  Again, if you recollect that Sidney was a Baptist at heart, you can now consider that he introjected many of his worldviews into the Book of Mormon.  And if Sidney included some Baptist expansion, it would seem the authority element of the story of Alma was neglected.

Another obvious question is:  why would a "perfect translation" of the Book of Mormon (inferred by the modern polemics anchored to the Article of Faith distinguishing Joseph's work from Biblical translations) not be perfectly followed?  Apologists offer no explanation other than "Joseph changed it."  So the question is:  why would Joseph change it?  Was it one of those edits of Oliver being tricky?  Or something more foundational?

Now consider the lynchpin of the argument.  The description of the Christian doctrine in 3 Nephi as precisely:  faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost with concise rhetoric that any additions to this simple doctrine is not the TRUE doctrine.  Today, the believers within the Brigham synod must carefully follow the Word of Wisdom (originally given as counsel not commandment) and must honor the doctrine of the tithe (it is mentioned in 3 Nephi, so it counts, right?) in order to get their version of a Costco card to enter into the exclusive temple and its rites and rituals.  A faithful apologist will anchor to: the "living prophet" updates the doctrine (that Yeshua outlined as needing no update) based on the times and seasons in which we live.  Sadly, that logic is as reliable as some thought conditioning in Orwellian novels such as 1984 or Animal Farm.  

It seems evident that the early Mormon movement did NOT have the concerns with "inerrancy" as modern Mormon followers do; almost as if they knew that an expansion had occurred so they gave less weight to certain ideas presented.  

The passing of generations will often lead to loss of knowledge stores.  This can be seen today with the modern claim of the "prophet, seer, and revelator."  In Joseph's era, this was a vote of confidence of the members that they loved and supported the man that communed with Jehovah.  It was likely well established at the time that Joseph was Prophet because he brought forth the Ancient Record that got translated into a religious movement via the publication of the Book of Mormon.   When Brigham won favor with the majority following Joseph's death, he defined himself as President.  Other factions defined their leadership after Joseph's death as guardians or stewards.  No one dared make the claim that they were a Prophet like Joseph.  But time marches on.  And a few decades later, the Church body in Utah did indeed declare that Brigham was a "prophet, seer, and revelator".  A tradition that continues today.  Interestingly, Brigham used this "time-marches-on" principle to institutionalize the Word of Wisdom; his advice to stake presidents was simple:  'let the old English ladies drink their black tea and we will enforce this as doctrine among the rising generation.'


#### David Whitmer's Testimony
David Whitmer owned the entirety of a manuscript which the Brigham synod classifies as the "printer manuscript".  Oliver Cowdery, before his death in 1850, gifted this manuscript to David Whitmer.  Although David disengaged from the Mormon movement, he valued this gift.  The year before his death, 1887, at the age of 82, David published a narrative of his Mormon experience in "An address to all believers in Christ: A witness to the divine authority of the Book of Mormon."   


Before his death, ambassadors from the Brigham synod visited David to discuss the possibility of acquiring his manuscript.  The Brigham messengers were trying to emphasize to the old-timer that the manuscript was the "printer's edition" NOT the "original edition."  David ademantly rejected the idea: it was an original.  Negotiations collapsed.  And maybe this meeting motivated David to finish his personal narrative.  In 1903, a grandson of David Whitmer would sell the inherited manuscript to the Community of Christ, the RLDS or Smith-lineage synod of the Mormon movement.  In 2017, the Brigham synod would finally acquire this manuscript from the Community of Christ paying over $30 million.

Synthesizing of the Whitmer testimony, in context of the translation process, is revealing.  Why would David be so ademant he had the "original" manuscript?  Was he just a confused old man?  Or is there something more to the testimony?  First, if you compare the original manuscript to the printer's edition, you will notice that there are many, many more scribal errors of sloppiness in the printer's edition.  If the "original manuscript" were literally "from the voice of Joseph to the pen of Oliver" would it not have more such errors?  The comparisons would suggest that the crafted "original" was carefully written, and likely unrushed.  In contrast, the "printer's edition", which was likely copied from the crafted original, was sloppy and likely hurried.

//-->

Martin Harris, the financier of this endeavor, was reportedly buying paper and other scribal tools frequently.  If carefully computed, significantly more paper is purchased than is needed.  All of this points to the likely reality that the manuscript went through editions before defining a prepared form:  mistakenly called the "original" manuscript or the "earliest text." 

Now, again, why would David Whitmer be so ademant?  One, he was old and confused. Was David not aware that in October 1841 Joseph Smith interred the "original" in a stone box as part of the cornerstone of the Nauvoo house?  Two, he was old and not confused.  Correctly, he was not distinguishing the contents of "an" original from what was being described as "the" original.  Maybe even, David bristled in obstinance which would have ended any possible negotiations with the Brigham messengers.  Did David imagine that Brigham was sending a veiled message (similar to what Brigham did when Joseph Smith III visited Utah to learn more of his heritage; Brigham suggested Joseph ask his mother Emma about polygamy)?  If both Brigham and David knew that the original/printer manuscript was not the earliest text but would swear it was the "original" manuscript, Brigham may have had strategic intent to send such a message.  (Brigham died in 1877, ten years before David.  It would seem that several attempts were made by the Utah cohort to interact with David.  Sometimes, just missionaries that just wanted to see the manuscript.  Other times, officially sanctioned visits.)

So, if an earliest text does exist, why is it that we do not have any testimonies about its existence?  Did the early Church movement use Mahan for good; that is, were certain secrets sealed with blood-oaths?  Recall, that until 1990, the Brigham synod emphasized blood-oath secrets within their endowment ceremony in the temple.  And today, if you ask old-timers about certain aspects of the temple, they also get ademant and a bit bristly.  Maybe they also had made secret oaths that are different and less benign that those receiving their endowments after 1990.  Customized testimony-meetings and prayer circles in local Church buildings were also quietly ended in 1978 after Spencer W. Kimball sent an internal memo to local church leaders on May 3.  Bruce R. McConkie may have told reporters the reason for such a change was that top-down governing was becoming more difficult as stake presidents and other local leaders were using secret oaths, testimonies, and prayer circles to guide local membership on unique spiritual paths.  Likely, at some point, early Church leadership including Joseph Smith, David Whitmer, and Brigham Young participated in similar old-school prayer circles.

So, if an earliest text does exist, and David Whitmer made a "blood-oath of secrecy" with Joseph Smith to not reveal this, then his ademant expression that THIS is the original text (unconcerned with which copy) was astute, not ignorant.  The messengers were focused on the distinction between the original/printer copies when the pushed the issue with David; David was likely internally reflecting on a more sober secret and oath (no, there is NO earlier text; this COPY is like the COPY interred at the Nauvoo House, the original manuscript).  Brigham himself would also be aware of the circumstances related to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, but likely sent emissaries that were not "in the known" of any such secret oaths.  Isolating knowledge into silos is a classic example of preserving power as it creates information assymetry.  The power of Mahan.  Over time, such institutional strategies creates the loss of knowledge stores.

David Whitmer summarized his personal beliefs near the end of his life.  First, Joseph Smith received innovative content regarding Ancient America.  Second, Joseph Smith kept receiving innovative content which at some point disenfranchised David.  Third, David described this disenfranchisement anchored to a teaching received from Joseph:  innovative content can come from within (the ideas of the man), or from the celestial (the good guys), or from the celestial (the bad guys).  That is, David concluded that Joseph was receiving new content from incorrect sources.

### Summary of Editorialization in Translation Process
The celestial commission seems to have been "bring forth this Ancient American record."  Whether through personal ambitions or through additional directives beyond the primary marvelous work and wonder (singular), Joseph Smith leveraged the unique content in the Ancient American record to craft a religious movement.  Joseph's innovative content was an asset that Sidney could leverage in context of his own desires and ambitions.  A synergistic "win-win".  Likely, the collaboration was discussed after Sidney lost his association with the Baptist group and was rebuilding using the Campbellite framework, mixed with his profound beliefs in "infant salvation by grace" that was essential to his person.  

When summarizing motivation, one can easily conclude that (1) Joseph wanted to start a religious movement like his uncle did and (2) Sidney wanted to reform the Baptist/Campbellite theocracy to emphasis infant salvation.  Together, they were a force.  Sidney had the logic and rhetoric.  And Joseph had original content which cannot be easily dismissed.  

A pact was likely formed with a specific strategy that would require couriers: maybe Parley P. Pratt and/or Hyrum Smith.  Hyrum would be the most obvious choice as his arrival at Joseph's home would be mundane.  Maybe he would cover a portion of the distance and transfer the papers to Parley who would then cover the remaining distance delivering them to Sidney.

Sure, we can remove the phrase "And it came to pass" ([ha-yah] palindrome in Hebrew) and we may have a short pamphlet (literary criticism of Samuel Clemens, aka, Mark Twain).  Fundamentally, it seems Clemens was correct (about the Legend of Nephi at least): it was intended to be a small pamplet.  This small record was intended to be "plain and precious" for Nephi's children and posterity: very precise teachings with a reading list from Isaiah (Isaiah was pre-exilic Hebrew; that is, also written in the language of the Egyptians with the culture of the House of Jacob).  Due to the circumstances of the lost pages and the desire for Sidney to pontificate his Pauline Campbellite Trinitarian worldview, this small record became much, much more.  And because the Book of Lehi was lost, certain addendums had to be added for clarity of the narrative.   Regardless, as a seeker of truth, I would like to separate Nephi's masterpiece from its editorialization.

I am capable of believing that Joseph Smith received an ancient record, and this was written down as an original text.  This does imply that Joseph had some prophetic gifts, that in modern parlance could easily be defined as channelling.  A celestial voice communicated to Joseph, which he would then voice, which was then transcribed.  At times, Joseph would hear a word that he could not fully pronounce (e.g., [Lehi](https://www.reverso.net/text-translation#sl=heb&tl=eng&text=%25D7%259C%25D6%25B8%25D7%2590%25D6%25B4%25D7%2599%25D6%25BC%25D6%25B4) {Isa 42:15}), so it would seem, a letter-by-letter English spelling would be provided from the celestial.  And with Joseph's accent, you wonder if some names like "Coriamtumea" may have become "Coriantumr" (dialect of northeast where idea becomes idear).

This process was likely tedious.  Joseph would hear a word in a foreign dialect, and not be able to easily repeat the word, so would spell it out (likely with celestial guidance).  David Whitmer used the example of "Sariah" that he considered very easy (so Joseph must be dumb).  But if you listen to the potential language, as in the Lehi example above, one can have some degree of compassion for Joseph's linguistic shortcomings.  And if the translation process was full of such names, a best-guess would be to anchor to traditional Biblical names and pronounciations such as those found in [Walker's 1826 pronunciation guide](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044100036904&seq=457).  

After voiced and transcribed, the contents would then be scrutinized,  reviewed, discussed, debated, and pontificated.  As BH Roberts predicted: a day would come when science would triangulate the veracity of the Ancient American Record.  BH Roberts had a unique position as he had direct access to all of the remnants of the writings of Joseph's time and season that the Brigham synod possessed.  And maybe these primary documents are carefully preserved in a vault.  If so, in full transparency, they should be released.  However, sadly, if past protocols have been preserved, the primary documents were burned.

Yet, as BH Roberts concluded, I am able to embrace my Mormon roots and heritage:  the good, the bad, and the ugly.  It is a cultural heritage into which I was born and raised.  So I will cherish the experience, exploration, and education (D&C 122).  Without my upbringing to teach me the intricacies of the faith's movement, it would have been impossible to develop the thesis that the Book of Mormon was an editorialized expansion of an original Ancient American Record.

### Common Problem of Editorialization 
Editorialization is a common problem any time an ancient scripture passes through the hands of a scribe.  More so, when it passes through the hands of a translator.  Even more so, when it passes through the hands of a reformist.    Reformationists always have strong beliefs opposing the status quo.  And reformists try and recraft the Christian system based on internal beliefs.  Consider the 95 theses articulated by Martin Luther as he prepared a German translation of the Bible.  That is, although Luther was rational in his articulation of the 95, Luther had internal belief systems that would define his movement just as severely and irrationally as the Catholic tradition.  Although Luther wanted to unite the evangelical movements (e.g., Anabaptists), he struggled with their unique practices that were contrary to his worldview of what an evangelical movement should be.

#### Isaiah 
Consider carefully, the writings of Isaiah.  According to the contents of the Book of Mormon, both Nephi and Yeshua called these writings great.  And one day, we may be able to read them.  For now, we are left with broken/modified renderings.  

Isaiah was given the gift of a quick-tongue and utilized this gift to try and guide the leadership of his day to choose the right.  For example, when he takes his teenage son to examine the conduit that feeds the Gihon spring into the city of Jerusalem, he intentionally encounters King Ahaz and offers unsolicited advice.  Isaiah first offers a sign that Ahaz refuses, by telling Ahaz that his betrothed young maiden accompanying him was pregnant with a son who will become a righteous king.  Isaiah counsels with Ahaz that "Syria is confederate with Ephraim" predicting the demise of the Northern Kingdom.  

Taken together, this contains strong Hebraic imagery.  Confederacy is analagous to a betrothal, a contract that has not been consummated.  A very concrete parallelism.  Isaiah later calls Jerusalem a daughter of Babylon, a harlot.  That is, "Babylon was confederate with Jerusalem" and contractually consummated the bondage.

##### Proper names or generalized meaning?
As Isaiah is reviewed, it needs to be done so carefully, not with modern distortions associated with the broken language and tradition.  For example, the proper names Isaiah uses:  Syria, Babylon, Jerusalem, Zion.  Are they being used specifically or generically?  Consider the prophesy of Isaiah 2, the establishment of Zion and Jerusalem.   Most believers in the Judeo-Christian tradition believe that this implies that after the fall of Jerusalem where Isaiah had lived, the same location would be restored and recovered.  That is, this prophecy has NOT yet been fulfilled.

If you were to ask Nephi, who likened these scriptures unto himself, he would reply something like "fue hecho" ('I did it').  But not in the same location as the words "zion" and "jerusalem" having meaning independent of the City of David in the Levant.  No need to find a red heifer without blemish.  No need to see if any of the descendants of Levi actually know how the sacrificial system used to work.  No need because Nephi was a near-future after Isaiah, and he fulfilled the tasks assigned to him.  He got things done.

After crafting his first ploughshare to move dirt to launch his first ship, Nephi later carefully studied the Isaiah scripture and realized he had fulfilled at least one of Isaiah's God-given prophecies.  At some point after the realization, an interpretation of Isaiah's prophecies may have guided Nephi in his actions.  For Nephi, Zion and Jerusalem would refer to their original meanings: zion (sunny hilltop) representing the scepter and ruling function of society and jerusalem (teachings of peace) representing the staff and teaching function of society.   That is the generic forms have nothing to do with the specific implementations in the Levant.  Likely Isaiah was part of the MISNE, possibly its leader, and Nephi would have known all of this.  As a remnant of the house of Jacob, Nephi fulfilled many of Isaiah's prophecies.  

The region commonly called the Levant today has had many names.  Geographically, Jerusalem was the buffer between the societies of Egypt and the northern societies:  Syria, Assyria, Babylon (local territory within entire region: city of Babylon in the land of Babylon analagous to the city of Zerahemla in the land of Zerahemla).  Abraham, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, was promised a land of inheritance that included the Nile River system, all of Arabia to the borders of the mountains of modern Turkey.  What did the ancients call this region?  Certainly portions of the region were possibly named Egypt (Mizraim) and Canaan (or some derivative), but what was the expression for the entirety of the region promised to Abraham? Well, in context of the generic meaning of babel, this region of the world was the land of babel; that is Babylon.  Abraham was inheriting the land of chaos/confusion (babel) on a planet with many distinct regions.  Abraham seems to be the fixer who was commissioned to transform Babylon (this chaotic region) into a kingdom of peace (Zion/Jerusalem).  According to Nephi, such a fix was only necessary because the locals (described as Canaanites in the editorialized Book of Mormon) would not turn back to the norms before the chaos.  The point is that we do not have the worldview of the ancients, so when a term like Babel or Babylon is used, is that in a very local time-specific context within the region or does that reflect the entire region?  Such a distinction is important if the ancients accepted polygenesis and did not try to craft a narrative that claimed this one region of the world populated the entirety of the world.

##### Palace (and Temple) Intrigue 
Sometimes a king, like Josiah, would have a wife from competing regions to help with diplomacy: Egypt and Babylon/Assyria.  Josiah, a "righteous" king, respected his scepter as zion thereby taking counsel from the staff of jerusalem (the MISNE).  When renovating the temple, ancient documents were discovered and Josiah executed the counsel given to him by a prophetess in the MISNE. Within the MISNE, as Nephi teaches us, there were varying viewpoints regarding the correct direction for the house of Jacob in relations with its neighbors.  Both Isaiah and Jeremiah seemed to have a pro-Egypt perspective.  And Nephi's family, being taught in the manner of the Hebrews in the language of Egypt, was likely part of a pro-Egypt perspective.  However, the Egyptian leadership starting with Necho was possibly placed in power by Assyria.  A careful reading of the Necho-Josiah encounter may suggest that a group of KOHEN had established a temple in Elephantine and had taken the Ark of the Covenant.  A pro-Egypt perspective in Jerusalem may have had mixed feelings that a splinter-KOHEN group removed the Ark of the Covenant from its retirement in the temple of Jehovah that builded Solomon and now was taking it to war with Necho.  So when Necho marches to fight Babylon (and aid Assyria), and Josiah intercepts the march, the drama only increases.  Likely, the Ark was recovered but Josiah died in the process leaving behind two wives with competing diplomatic loyalties.  The primary point being that the palace and temple intrigue was unsustainable and Jerusalem would be destroyed.

Nephi left the drama of the region and went to an old nation to teach them and (reluctantly) to rule over them.  He was both the scepter and the staff, both zion and jerusalem.  Nephi was the great KORESH, a title of significance also mentioned in Isaiah.

##### The Great Scroll of Isaiah 
Isaiah like Nephi, would have written in a form of Hebrew today called Early Paleo-Hebrew or pre-exilic Hebrew.  That is, the Egyptian glyphs and characters would represent the Hebrew language.  For example, the same glyph that would mean "m" in Hebrew and would be one of the glyphs that represented the "n" in Egyptian.  Furthermore, the alphabet was likely more than 22 characters and the diacritics and cantillations were nonexistent.  All in all, if Isaiah were to examine the Great Scroll of Isaiah discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls (dated approximately 100 BC), he would be unable to read it.  Even if he would understand what was written, he would be baffled and confused by the deviations.

##### Kheresh becomes Deutero-Isaiah
Isaiah writes in the Hebrew language using Egyptian characters.  Jerusalem falls.  A minority flees to Egypt.  The majority of the upper-class is taken captive to the city of Babylon for proper re-education where they learn the cuneiform writing system; from which a new Hebrew form develops.  Over time, additional cantillation markers and diacritics are added to aid the pronunciation of ambiguous character combinations.  To preserve the ancient wisdom in this new language map, translators convert the Early Paleo-Hebrew (Egyptian characters of Hebrew language) writings of Isaiah into post-exilic Hebrew.  

Maybe KHERESH was appropriately identified early on, meaning the Master of the flame/furnace.  As the centuries passed, an ambitious and ignorant translator assumes that Cyrus the King of Persia was maybe the KHERESH Isaiah was describing, it was prophetic!  Yes, KHERESH was a prophetic description by Isaiah. Not of Cyrus the Persian but of Nephi.  Much later, when another translator in Europe applies the false assumption that the earlier translator made, he points out an anachronism: how could Cyrus of Persia be a good guy, anointed by God!  And the beginning of the Deutero-Isaiah philosophy begins.  


KHER-ESH has two Egyptian roots has many potential meanings.  ESH could mean husband, a man becomes a husband when he embraces the warmth fire of a woman's breasts.  KHER in Egyptian generally means "overseer" or "master" or "lord".  The title of KHERESH for Nephi has several layers of meaning.  All very literal.  Literally, Nephi is the master of the furnace.  He brings foundry technologies to America melting gold, silver, copper/tin/nickel, and iron embedded with coal.  And for his people, he is literally the guardian and protector, the overseer of protecting the family units, symbolized by female breasts (the family hearth).  

Finally, it is worth noting that KHERESH is a placeholder for what Isaiah intended.  Maybe he used a variant (KHEPESH has been found as a potential alternative so KHEFESH is also a possibility in the broken Hebrew).  Maybe he used a synonym that was closer to Nephi's name as found in Esdras.  As this is unknown, a placeholder is used with an understanding that more data may require another iteration and update.
