## Book of Mormon as "Translation" of Ancient American Record

There are many that will devoutly swear the polemic logic outlined by the Book of Mormon itself (Moroni 10) and institutionalized as the proselyting logic by Talmage:  if the Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith must have been a prophet, and therefore, the Church he created but be the only TRUE and LIVING Church in all the world.

### Proof the "translation" process included "editorialization"
To begin, the absurdity of the polemics argument will be challenged.  Then, definite proof that the Book of Mormon has embedded an Ancient American Record will be developed.  Taken together, the triangulation of logic will justify BH Roberts prevailing counter-stance to the Talmage efforts:  the Ancient American Record was a vehicle used by men (with their philosophies) to develop a religious institution that hopefully helps people develop a relationship with the celestial.

#### Situational Context
The young Joseph Smith Jr., according to the official timeline, received celestial visitations on September 21, 1823.  Was that Saturday night, September 20th into Sunday early AM, September 21st?  Regardless of the minutiae, these "visitations of angels" as later described occurred during a FULL moon [https://nineplanets.org/moon/phase/9-20-1823/].

The Book of Mormon was published in 1830.  Between these time posts, the Ancient Record had to be retrieved, original text had to be dictated and edited and prepared for publication.  The printer made note how the prepared manuscript (internally called by believers the "original manuscript" copied as the "printer's manuscript) had little punctuation and many run-on sentences.  The key scholar in this domain is Royal Skousen who would only "step out of line" to conclude that Oliver was tricky.  This means that, according to Royal, Oliver Cowdery would make edits to the manuscript and Joseph kept having to review the work to make certain this did NOT continue.

- Critical analysis of the location of run-on sentence density and poor grammar and punctation will very likely reveal that certain segments of text seemed to have fewer such problems.  I would set forth as a proposition that many of the so-called speeches of the Book of Mormon meet this criteria.

What is essential to the internal narrative was to contemporaneoulsy thwart the "Solomon Spalding" source for the contents of the Book of Mormon.  [http://sidneyrigdon.com/]  Although a careful examination will find this accusation lacking in evidence, the point that the early Church considered the accusation worthy of thwarting - this is the key data point.

- Sidney Rigdon was a RedStone Baptist removed from this association for pushing "infancy salvation" so much; Sidney had a large Campbellite following and was seeking "new gospel material" to grow his ministry.  This is a key data point regarding "Solomon Spalding".  And very likely, as you consider the Pauline Baptist contents interlaced throughout the 1830 Book of Mormon, Sidney Rigdon was a co-author with Joseph Smith Jr. and Oliver was merely a scribal secretary that was responsible for merging the two threads into one coherent manuscript.

Once you can recognize the intentional efforts to leverage the Ancient American Record to grow a church movement, the ability to identify the Pauline Baptish Campbellite Ridgon philosophies are much more plausible.  For antagonists, this fine point is irrelevant; the baby goes out with the bathe water.  For apologists, this is too uncomfortable of a reality based on the more constrained and controlling the internal messaging is.

#### Church purpose
The early Church went through several institutional changes very rapidly: (1) the idea organization of Joseph Smith, (2) the Whitmer influence, (3) the Rigdon influence, (4) the Brigham synod with smaller schism movements, (5) the Talmage polemics, (6) the Hinckley bureaucracy, (7) the Nelson 'trust leadership' like 'holding to the iron rod' messaging.

Joseph Smith, Jr. had an uncle who started a Church (Lucy's brother) after having adventures on the high seas (possible source of the idea for Joseph Smith, Sr.: grow gingseng and sell to China; but no family member went on the ship and the fortune was lost/stolen) and losing the 'love of his life.'  This obvious data point is overlooked by many; internally may be intentionally overlooked to frame a simple First Vision narrative anchored to the Epistle of Jacob (vulgarly called James).

When Joseph Smith, Jr. did initiate the Church, he communicated that he wanted it to be a "religion without creeds" and was immediately under pressure by those around him to outline official creeds.  Olivery Cowdery had a draft of 8 such creeds that Joseph Smith was well aware of in 1830 but would not adopt (or be forced to adopt by institutional pressures) until a decade later.  If I recollect, Joseph attended a early Church service with Oliver where a member of the Congregation felt moved by the spirit and in what we would term modernly a Pentecostal moment, the man swung from the rafters singing praises, speaking in tongues, until he hit his head severely and was unconscious for a time.  Oliver likely turned to Joseph and reminded him that creeds were a necessary evil.

#### Oliver Context
Oliver married one of the Whitmer daughters and the Whitmer home was where the most important translation occurred, the final chapter of the process: the small plates of Nephi.  Mother Whitmer was milking the cow when Brother Nephi appeared to her as a normal man and showed her these records; she was likely the first witness of this physical Ancient American Record.  Yet, she was a woman, so in 1830's America, her witness was excluded.  As 8 is greater than 3, this second record was the entire purpose of the first record.  The former was a training and trial period, the latter was the main event.

Mother Whitmer was exhausted taking care of the men staying with her.  This describes the nature of the environment of the Whitmer home.  Joseph would receive some original text of the Ancient American Record, and the men would spend hours pouring over every word and philosophizing on its meaning and implication.  And based on the worldviews of the Whitmers, a basic organization began the Church with Joseph and Oliver as First Elders.  No one doubted Joseph was a prophet because the content he was creating was new, novel, and inspiring.  However, in the Whitmer era, that did not mean the institution should have hierarchy; there would be lots of Elders equal in the eyes of God; Joseph and Oliver happened to be the first such Elders.  Joseph would form an idea of School of the Prophets with an inclusive definition as anyone with the "spirit of testimony of Jesus" which again would get hampered to be a men-only organization.  This would explain why so many women of the early Church were so enamored with him; he was trying to give them a place of equality within the religion; in fact, their own body of religious service (the Relief Society).  Joseph was trying to restore the ancient MISNE which can be interpreted as college or school of the prophets and prophetesses.  The most important remnant of this ancient institution was the story of King Josiah who received counsel from the prophetess Huldah (the keeper of the wardrobe within the MISNE) and followed her spiritual direction exactly.  1830's America was not interested in such things within an institutional religion, but such views would enamore the feminine with Joseph's vision of God's Church.

Hiram Page witnesses this translation phenomenon that Joseph performs and wants to give it a try using his own personal seer stone (Hiram married into the Whitmer family and many of the Whitmers had such stones).  Joseph is anxious, and after carefully consideration, convinces the core group to destroy the Hiram stone, burn the revelation, and so begins the natural gravities of power formation.

Taking a step back, how did Joseph and the Whitmers become so strongly connected?  The connection was through Oliver Cowdery.  Hyrum Smith, Joseph's older brother was a member of the local school board and hired Oliver Cowdery; in fact, the brother of Oliver was hired but could not perform the duties so Oliver was the replacement.  Such a data point may be factually true, or may be a contrived narrative to make the entire Church-building process more palatable.  

#### Bone Surgery
Regardless, the data remains that Hyrum Smith had some local prominence and even had connections at a local school of higher education.  This same school had some of the first doctors openly practicing surgery in 1800s America.  The "bone surgery" story of Joseph's youth demonstrates that: (1) Lucy Mack had money to pay doctors for their constant visits (20 total doctors participated in Joseph's diagnosis and treatment), (2) Joseph would spend significant time in medical settings and therefore would have advanced access to the belief systems of these doctors, (3) Lucy Mack was convinced to perform a surgery on her son based on limited evidence (and modern uncertainty) being assured that a leg surgery did not have the same spiritual consequence as a surgery in the human core (which was considered spiritual blaspheme among Christians), (4) Joseph's typhoidal (more likely syphilic) condition is a cosmic tie-in to the "sore curse" described in the Book of Mormon that could turn a man or woman black down there (in region of 1830's shame).

#### Early formation without Sidney 
During the manuscript creation process, a portion of the creation was lost when Joseph loaned Martin Harris the first "116" handwritten pages of the manuscript.  Martin significantly financed the entrepreneurial enterprise.  Martin helped Joseph move by giving him $50 and promised to finance much of the printing costs of the first edition of the Book of Mormon.  Martin mortgaged some property as collateral and would turn a very healthy profit once the Book of Mormon was published and sold.

Again, this classic narrative has key data points that are largely ignored.  The first is:  why would Martin even consider asking if others were not doing the same?  If you review the history carefully, before the official 6 April 1830 official church formation (with legal business license and everything), missionaries were called to share the good news of the Messianic visit to Ancient America.  One such mission was Joseph's brother Don Carlos.  These missionaries would show up at the "translation shack" and copy portions of texts from the preparing manuscript and would share those with interested parties to prepare for the release of the entire narrative in book form: an ability to try before you buy the book, a most basic marketing (proselyting) tactic.  It is estimated that before 6 April, over 1700 had already been baptized.   After 6 April, Joseph suggested they get "re-baptized" as he did not have an anchor like many established ministers of "one baptism".  Of interest is the question:  where are these scraps of paper?  To a devout believer, these fragments would be highly valued.  Maybe the vault of the Mormon synod keeps them under lock and key, but if you follow the narrative of the time, the reality is a bit more mundane.  Joseph Smith likely demanded the scraps be collected and burned BEFORE the interested party could receive the entire book.  

A second key data point is:  where was the source material to attempt to recreate the lost pages?  The official narrative is that Joseph tried to recraft the narrative which mostly consisted of the Book of Lehi with a few chapters about Mosiah/Benjamin.  God inspired Joseph to stop because the ability to achieve something exactly the same was impossible.  Of course it is!  Have you ever written a long treatise and lose the entire document.  The next draft will deviate significantly from the original draft if lost.  But to a group of men with mediocre education and a belief that the devil was trying to thwart their work and that lesser men will think lesser of the work if compared, this thinking process makes complete sense.  This just informs us as to the logical frame of Joseph and his inner circle.  

Next, to do such a recreation, it is very likely they had original notes (which I will call the TRUE original text).  To me, this is an important anchor to the veracity of some ancient source material.  Joseph and his editors had source material (that seemingly Joseph provided) that got translated meaning it got verbosely described in what this group considered to be elegant and intelligent language when, in fact, it was old Biblical English that was 30-40 years antiquated.  

Furthermore, in an effort to "beat the devil at his game" (again an ignorant perspective because if you are playing the devil's game, you have already lost), the content that was lost was carefully sprinkled in thereafter as possible.  If you read the legend of Nephi carefully (1 Nephi and 2 Nephi), several times an introjection is made:  "I Nephi will tell my story, but let me get back to my father's story first."  And of course, if you can buy a few mummies and ancient papyrus, what a great way to include other fragments from the original text (the Book of Abraham) or just claim you received it by inspiration as you began translating the Old Testament (the Book of Moses).  Et oila!  A Pearl of Great Price!

Finally, the edits were intentional for building a religious movement in the 1830s.  That is, the original text said X which was massaged into X' to present a favorable message that could be adopted in that era.  Some possible clues of such changes are found in 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi:  (1) a conflation of the "parents" where the man is the visionary and the woman complains, (2) the removal of the narrative about the Ark of the Covenant, (3) the removal of other key ideas that would be ridiculed in 1830s America: the name Colon-mbia, the word America the Bountiful (or Beautiful), ...

When the final translation occurs, the legend of Nephi, the goal is to sprinkle in clarifying details from the lost pages while making it appear to be Nephi doing the summation.  If the lost pages are ever revealed by another party, the vaguity provides justification.  Years later, the lost pages are not revealed, so the main threads of significance are revealed as a Pearl of Great Price.

#### Sidney involvement
Now, overlay the Sidney variable.  Sidney was older with a belief a careful grammar from his generation.  Sidney believed that "children were saved through the grace of Jesus" if they were not of an age of accountability - read Moroni again, that could be a Sidney sermon aggregated to a very terse set of original writings.

Sidney was dismissed from his Baptist association for his strong views on "infant salvation" and for a time was looking for a way to grow his own Church.  Between 1823 and 1826 he was being approached by people with new and novel religious ideas.  Upstate New York was not significantly distant from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.  Maybe Joseph directly approached Sidney.  Maybe it was done indirectly through Oliver or Hyrum or someone else.  Regardless, linguistic analysis easily will demonstrate that Sidney participated in the editorialization of the original text Joseph was preparing.  Now, things fit together.  Portions of the original text were being given to missionaries.  Other portions were being sent to another party who had his own entrepreneurial proclivity.  Martin sees these things.  Martin has given Joseph $50.  Martin has agreed to finance the publication.  Others have been interacting with the manuscript in its development, "Joseph, please let me show my wife."  After the event (the loss), the provenance is tighter and a copy-of-a-copy is always created so the working manuscript cannot be lost again.

Interestingly, the Brigham synod claims that there are very few original writings and sermons available of Sidney so a careful analysis can be performed.  With a history of "burning evidence", such data may actually not exist.  Or may be sealed up, hidden in a vault somewhere.  What little we have is from the careful and copious notes of Wilford Woodruff who left the ever important breadcrumb of leadership think: "we will beat the devil at his game".  We have reference to two sermons from Sidney.  One is called the Salt Sermon, and very little details remain, but many claim it was a tirade.  Sidney after merging with the early Church was NOT happy with some of the allowed practices.  For example, when Joseph was throwing sticks and wresting after Sunday service, Sidney rushes upon the group with a sword in hand and declares that they must repent as such things are NOT of God's Church!  Since he was earlier nearly beaten to death when a printing press was destroyed and Sidney/Joseph were tar and feathered, Sidney suffered.  In modern parlance, we may possibly conclude that he suffered from a TBI (traumatic brain injury).  Once, he may have tried to kill his wife.  Another time, he gives a savage Salt Sermon.  But the key data point is the one sermon we have nearly in its entirety, thanks to Wilford Woodruff.

Now, if Joseph and Sidney had some arrangment and collaboration before 1830, the narrative of the later merger would be devised, prepared, and implemented.  This one sermon seems to identify that reality, if read carefully.  A TBI survivor often drops inhibitions especially when excited or agitated.  In this sermon, Sidney was given a chance to speak at a large conference - for the first time in a long time.  Sidney reflected on when he first visited the early Joseph Church and emphasized that it was a very small meeting house and only had 40 or so participants.  Sidney then reflected on how he brought 17,000 or more to the movement during the Kirtland era that had grown even more during the time of the sermon (Nauvoo era).  Reading between the lines, Sidney was saying to Joseph:  "Your Church would be nothing without me, don't you ever forget it!"  And it was largely true.  Most of the modern institutional structures were developed during the Rigdon era (Kirtland and Nauvoo).  In fact, Brigham to create his synod had to make several significant changes to empower the Quorum of the Twelve.

Now, why would Brigham think he was allowed to make such drastic institutional changes?  Well, from observation and experience, Brigham saw it happen often.  The inner councils, such as the original Council of Fifty, likely discussed this extensively.  It was likely well established at the time that Joseph was Prophet because he brought forth the Ancient Record that got translated into a religious movement via the publication of the Book of Mormon.  In my estimation, Sidney was the primary co-author and Oliver was the grafter of the two branches into the book product form.

The best example of such confluence would be the parable that Jacob shares with his children on the small plates.  Is it a parable of an olive tree in an oliveyard or a vine in a vineyard?  Which are more commonly grafted?  Why would Jacob include it?  Where was the source material and how did it related to the writings of Isaiah that Jacob's brother Nephi included?

America in the 1830s was very anti-Semitic.  The most educated of men would say the most demeaning and racist things about the Jews.  So the Jewish messaging in the Book of Mormon had to be carefully crafted.  At the time, the symbol of Jewery was the olive tree.  Sidney, proclaimed to be very well educated in such matters, likely was ademant that Joseph was mistaken in the original text received.  Recall, these men surrounding Joseph thought he was an idiot; Joseph didn't even know the city of Jerusalem had walls (as later witnessed by his friend, lover and confidante Emma).  Maybe Sidney was a bit condescending and arrogant.  And likely, the parable of the olive tree demonstrated his strong will in pushing through significant edits.  In his worldview, it had to be an olive tree!

Today, a more open-minded reader, could see the original context of the parable as a vine and a vineyard.  Likely, Joseph sent the original text in this form, Sidney made significant edits, and Oliver in attempting to merge the two says "tree" sometimes and "vine" other times.  Or a tree in the vineyard.  Of course, Jacob included this parable in his study of the Brass Plates.  And the anchor is Isaiah 5, which Nephi also included.  In Isaiah chapter 5, Isaiah is singing a song that seems to be an even older story about a vine and a vineyard.  At some point, it would seem, Jacob found the original source that inspired Isaiah to sing the song in Isaiah 5.  A vine was planted to bring forth beautiful fruit; it was polluted and brought forth bitter fruit (the fox grape).  As a tree represents a genealogy of a people with their branches and fruit, a vine similarly respresents fruit as children.  But unlike a tree, a vine is young and tender and has a different purpose.  This is the analogy, and YES, it does relate to sexual congress that allows for the coming forth of children.

More objectively, one can examine the pollen records of the Jerusalem era by studying soil samples taken from the depths of the Dead Sea.  Olive-tree pollen was not significant until about 200 BC, and had a major down-spike around 5 May 31 AD.  Indeed, if one considers the lilies of the field, the dust of the earth with cry forth its truth.  That is biblical speak for:  soil samples will reveal the true history of events, not the manufactured fiction of institutional forces.



#### Lack of internal institutional consistency
Consider for example the most important baptismal prayer:  "Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."  This prayer differs from what Yeshua personally taught in 3 Nephi:  "Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."  Further study reveals that Alma baptizing at the Waters of Mormon before the Messiah Death Event used entirely different language.  Among second-generation followers of the Brigham synod, leadership discussed an obvious question within the institutional framework: where and how did Alma get authority to baptize?

Another obvious question is:  why would a "perfect translation" of the Book of Mormon (inferred by the modern polemics anchored to the Article of Faith distinguishing Joseph's work from Biblical translations) not be perfectly followed?  Apologists offer no explanation other than "Joseph changed it."  So the question is:  why would Joseph change it?  Was it one of those edits of Olivery being tricky?  Or something more foundational?

Now consider the lynchpin of the argument.  The description of the doctrine as merely:  faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost with the further distinction that any additions to this doctrine is not the TRUE doctrine.  Today, the believers within the Brigham synod have to carefully follow the Word of Wisdom (originally given as counsel not commandment) and must honor the doctrine of the tithe (it is mentioned in 3 Nephi, so it counts, right?) in order to get their version of a Costco card to enter into the exclusive temple and its rites and rituals.  A faithful apologist will anchor to: the "living prophet" updates the doctrine (that Yeshua outlined as needing no update) based on the times and seasons in which we live.  Sadly, that logic is as reliable as some thought conditioning in American novels such as 1984 or Animal Farm.  One needs to merely review the establishment of the Brigham synod:  Brigham claimed no prophetic authority, personally knew Joseph and understood what a prophet was; rather, Brigham became the President of the Church, consolidated power to maintain control, and decades later, allowed the Church body declare that indeed he was a "prophet, seer, and revelator".

### Summary of Editorialization in Translation Process
The celestial commission seems to have been "bring forth this Ancient American record."  Whether through personal ambitions or through additional directives beyond the primary marvelous work and wonder (singular), Joseph Smith leveraged the novel content in the Ancient American record to craft a religious movement.  Joseph's novel content was an innovation that Sidney could leverage in context of his own desires and ambitions.  Likely, the collaboration was decided when Sidney lost his association with the Baptist group and was rebuilding in Ohio using the Campbellite framework, mixed with his profound beliefs in "infant salvation by grace" that was essential to his person.  Reformationists always have strong beliefs opposing the status quo, but internal beliefs can be as severe and strong as the status quo.  Compare this to Martin Luther's 95 theses against the Catholic tradition, yet his new religious movement would severely punish anyone that was anti-Trinitarian.

When summarizing motivation, one can easily conclude that (1) Joseph wanted to start a religious movement like his uncle did and (2) Sidney wanted to reform the Baptist/Campbellite theocracy to emphasis infant salvation.  Together, they were a force.  Sidney had the logic and rhetoric.  And Joseph had original content which cannot be dismissed flippantly.  Sure, we can remove the phrase "And it came to pass" ([ha-yah] palindrome in Hebrew) and we may have a short pamphlet (literary criticism of Samuel Clement, aka, Mark Twain).  My primary thesis would be Mark Twain was correct about the Legend of Nephi at least.  This small record was intended to be "plain and precious" for Nephi's children and posterity.  Due to the circumstances of the lost pages and the desire for Sidney to pontificate his Pauline Trinitarian worldview, this small record became much, much more.  And as a seeker of truth, I would like to separate Nephi's masterpiece from its editorialization.

I am capable of believing that Joseph Smith received an ancient record, and this was written down as an original manuscript.  This does imply that Joseph had some prophetic gifts, that in modern parlance could easily be defined as channelling.  A celestial voice communicated to Joseph and that information was transcribed.  And then reviewed, discussed, debated, and pontificated.  As BH Roberts predicted: a day would come when science would triangulate the veracity of the Ancient American Record.  BH Roberts had a unique position as he had direct access to all of the remnants of the writings of Joseph's time and season that the Brigham synod possessed.  And maybe these primary documents are carefully preserved in a vault.  If so, in full transparency, they should be released.  However, sadly, if past protocols have been preserved, the primary documents were burned.  The seer stone was placed in a safe until it resurfaced publicly much later.

Yet, as BH Roberts concluded, I am able to embrace my Mormon roots and heritage:  the good, the bad, and the ugly.  It is a cultural heritage into which I was born and raised.  So I will cherish the experience and exploration.  If I had not been prepared with such an upbringing, I could not develop this developing thesis:  the Book of Mormon was a editorialized expansion of an original Ancient American Record.
